        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_HIGH: [Top-k Minimax Noise Scheduling – Periodic Worst-Case Selection for Robust Watermark Robustness]\nInvisMark replaces conventional random noise augmentation with a practical robust-optimization objective that explicitly targets worst-case image transformations during training. Instead of sampling perturbations from a distribution each step, the method periodically re-evaluates a fixed bank of n transformations and trains against the k hardest ones, approximating a minimax objective without incurring prohibitive compute.\n\nThe core mechanism is a two-term recovery loss that adds a max-over-subset objective on transformed images to the standard clean-image BCE:\n\\[ L = \\alpha_q L_q(x,\\tilde{x}) + \\alpha_r L_r(\\omega,\\tilde{\\omega}) \\]\n\\[ L_r(\\omega,\\tilde{\\omega}) = \\mathrm{BCE}(\\omega, D(\\tilde{x})) + \\max_{I \\subset [0,n],\\, |I|=k} \\sum_{i \\in I} \\gamma_i \\,\\mathrm{BCE}\\big(\\omega, D(\\Phi_i(\\tilde{x}))\\big). \\]\nEvery T steps (T=200), the algorithm evaluates all noises Φi on a validation slice, selects the top-k hardest (by loss), and trains only on those until the next refresh; γi is held constant (0.5). This converts the per-iteration cost from O(n) evaluations to O(k) while amortizing an O(n) sweep every T steps, yielding an average step cost of O(k + n/T). With k=2, n≈15 and T=200, this is roughly a 100× reduction compared to naive per-step minimax, yet preserves the core worst-case emphasis.\n\nFundamentally, prior encoder–decoder watermarking either (i) relies on random augmentations (risking overfitting to average-case perturbations) or (ii) fixes a small set of transformations. InvisMark’s periodic worst-case selection shifts training toward the maximally destructive degradations present in the bank (e.g., rotation, random resized crop), yielding uniform robustness across heterogeneous transformations. The scheduling is stable because robustness is activated only after the fidelity stage (when αq is maximized), avoiding early non-convergence typical of exposing weak signals to strong geometric noise.\n\n\n### DESIGN_INSIGHT_MEDIUM: [Resolution-Scaled Residual Embedding with MUNIT Encoder and ConvNeXt Decoder – High-Resolution, High-Capacity Imperceptible Watermarks]\nInvisMark modifies the standard pixel-domain embedding by predicting low-resolution watermark residuals that are upscaled and added to the original image, replacing direct high-res perturbation. The pipeline takes a bitstring \\( \\omega \\in \\{0,1\\}^l \\), linearly projects it to a 3D tensor, upsamples and zero-pads it to match a downscaled view of the cover, and concatenates this with the resized image as encoder input. A MUNIT-based U-Net with skip connections produces residuals at low resolution, followed by multiple 1×1 convs for high-fidelity refinement; these residuals are then upscaled back to the native resolution and added to the cover to obtain \\( \\tilde{x} \\).\n\nFormally, InvisMark’s encoder can be written as:\n\\[ \\tilde{x} \\;=\\; E(x,\\omega) \\;=\\; x \\;+\\; S\\Big(f_\\theta\\big([D_s(x),\\,P(\\omega)]\\big)\\Big), \\]\nwhere \\( D_s \\) is downscaling, \\( P(\\omega) \\) is the message preprocessing (linear → 3D tensor → upsample → pad), \\( f_\\theta \\) is the MUNIT encoder with 1×1 conv post-processing, and \\( S(\\cdot) \\) denotes upscaling to original resolution. The decoder replaces ResNet-based heads with a ConvNeXt-base \\( D \\) (BN-free, stable on high-res), ending in an \\( l \\)-dimensional sigmoid:\n\\[ \\tilde{\\omega} \\;=\\; \\sigma\\!\\big(W \\, h_\\phi(\\tilde{x})\\big). \\]\n\nThis design differs from prior resolution-scaling methods (e.g., TrustMark) by (i) introducing a spatially structured message preprocessing that controls the watermark’s spatial distribution (improving geometric robustness and enabling co-embedding of multiple watermarks), (ii) leveraging a MUNIT-style encoder for content-preserving residual synthesis with skip connections plus 1×1 conv refinement, and (iii) adopting a ConvNeXt decoder to mitigate batch norm instability and better capture subtle high-frequency watermark cues. End-to-end training with scaling implicitly builds resilience to resizing and compression, enabling high-capacity payloads (up to 256 bits) with PSNR≈48–51 and SSIM≈0.997–0.998 at native resolutions.\n\n\n### DESIGN_INSIGHT_MEDIUM: [Low-Res Multi-Objective Fidelity Loss with Staged Training – Stable Convergence to Imperceptible, Robust Embeddings]\nInvisMark modifies the loss and schedule of encoder–decoder training to separate watermark detectability, image fidelity, and robustness, replacing single-objective or early heavy-augmentation schemes that often destabilize training. The image-quality loss is computed at the downscaled resolution (where residuals are synthesized), combining complementary criteria:\n\\[ L_q(x,\\tilde{x}) \\;=\\; \\beta_{\\text{YUV}} \\, \\|YUV(x)-YUV(\\tilde{x})\\|_2^2 \\;+\\; \\beta_{\\text{LPIPS}}\\, \\mathrm{LPIPS}(x,\\tilde{x}) \\;+\\; \\beta_{\\text{FFL}}\\, \\mathrm{FFL}(x,\\tilde{x}) \\;+\\; \\beta_{\\text{GAN}}\\, L_{\\text{WGAN}}(\\tilde{x}). \\]\nAll β are kept at 1.0 during training. Computing Lq at low resolution directly optimizes where the residual is created, reduces computational footprint, and improves gradient signal-to-noise for imperceptibility.\n\nTraining proceeds in three distinct stages controlled by \\( \\alpha_q \\): (1) watermark extraction pretraining with small \\( \\alpha_q \\) to let the decoder learn to detect a weak signal; (2) image reconstruction by ramping \\( \\alpha_q \\to \\alpha_{q,\\max} \\) (10.0), enhancing fidelity while preserving detectability; and (3) robustness enhancement by activating the top-k minimax loss \\( L_r \\) only after convergence of fidelity. This curriculum prevents early exposure to hard geometric transforms (rotation, random-resized-crop), which the authors observe can stall or destabilize learning, and it cleanly decouples objectives so the encoder learns to place minimally visible residuals before being required to survive worst-case perturbations. Compared to prior art that mixes all noises from the start or uses single-view pixel losses, this staged, multi-objective, low-res fidelity optimization yields markedly higher imperceptibility at high payloads while maintaining near-ceiling decode accuracy under diverse distortions.",

        "BACKGROUND": "**Title:** InvisMark: Invisible and Robust Watermarking for AI-generated Image Provenance\n\n**Historical Technical Context:**\nDigital image watermarking originated with pixel-domain schemes (e.g., least significant bit embedding) and frequency-domain methods (DWT/DCT, SVD) that modulate transform coefficients to hide signals. These classical approaches were lightweight and easily deployed, but generally brittle to common manipulations such as compression, resizing, and mild geometric transforms. As computer vision matured, CNN-based encoder–decoder architectures (e.g., U-Net variants) enabled learned steganography and watermarking in the spatial domain with perceptual losses (LPIPS) and adversarial training, improving both imperceptibility and robustness. Concurrently, vision backbones such as ResNet and later ConvNeXt improved feature extraction stability and capacity, while VAE/VQVAE and latent diffusion models (LDMs) became dominant for high-resolution image synthesis.\n\nThe rise of generative AI and concerns about deepfakes spurred provenance standards (C2PA) that bind signed metadata to assets. However, metadata can be stripped during social sharing, motivating “soft binding” via fingerprinting and watermarking. Fingerprinting relies on near-duplicate search in trusted repositories but often requires human verification, while watermarking promises exact matching by embedding an imperceptible identifier into the content itself. New watermarking paradigms co-train encoders/decoders with generative models (e.g., fine-tuning decoders of LDMs, or training on watermarked corpora), but these are model-specific and computationally intensive, with primary applications in detection or user identification rather than provenance.\n\nPost-generation neural watermarking matured through encoder–decoder methods like HiDDen, RivaGAN, and StegaStamp (which injected strong perturbations to withstand real-world distortions), as well as latent-space approaches (SSL) and VQVAE-based encoding (RoSteALS). TrustMark introduced universal resolution scaling to watermark arbitrary resolution images. Yet most systems were trained on low-resolution images, struggled to scale to modern high-res outputs (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL·E 3), and faced a practical payload–quality–robustness trade-off that typically limited payloads to <100 bits—too small for robust identifiers with error correction.\n\n**Technical Limitations:**\n- Scalability to high-resolution images: Prior encoder–decoder watermarking trained at 256×256 often degraded when naively scaled. For CNNs, memory and compute scale with spatial resolution O(HW) per feature map and O(HW·C·K^2) for convolution, making end-to-end high-resolution training prohibitive. Frequency-domain methods (DCT/DWT) add O(HW log HW) transforms but remain brittle. InvisMark reduces effective embedding compute by producing residuals at a downscaled resolution and upscaling, lowering the encoder’s memory/compute by ≈s^2 when downscaling by factor s.\n- Robust optimization overhead: Training for robustness against n distortions requires n additional forward passes per step to solve a minimax objective. InvisMark amortizes the cost by re-evaluating all noises every T=200 steps and training only on top-k=2 worst-case noises, reducing per-step overhead from O(n) to k + n/T ≈ 2 + 15/200 ≈ 2.075 decodes, a >7× reduction versus naïve worst-case training.\n- Payload capacity vs. imperceptibility/robustness: Existing methods typically cap payloads under 100 bits due to visible artifacts or fragile decoding, increasing ID collision risk under bit errors. InvisMark addresses this by demonstrating 256-bit payloads (e.g., 128-bit UUID + BCH ECC) with PSNR≈48 and SSIM≈0.997, maintaining ≥97% bit accuracy under challenging distortions.\n- Training instability with Batch Normalization: ResNet decoders using BN exhibited unstable training under heavy distortion distributions and resolution scaling. BN’s dependence on batch statistics caused variance drift; InvisMark adopts ConvNeXt (LayerNorm-based), stabilizing optimization and improving validation robustness.\n- Model-specific, compute-heavy generative watermarking: Methods that fine-tune LDM decoders or re-train on watermarked datasets incur substantial costs proportional to diffusion steps O(T) per sample and are tied to specific generators. InvisMark is post-generation and model-agnostic, avoiding LDM fine-tuning while achieving high robustness.\n- Vulnerability to advanced attacks: Adversarial latent-space perturbations and regeneration via diffusion/VAEs can remove watermarks when image quality degrades (observed thresholds near PSNR≈25). Prior systems lacked explicit mitigation; InvisMark proposes binding identifiers to content fingerprints to detect forgeries during provenance verification.\n\n**Paper Concepts:**\n- Resolution-Scaled Residual Embedding: The encoder E operates at a downscaled resolution s, producing residuals r that are upsampled and added to the original image to form the watermarked image. Formally, with a downscale operator S and an upscaler U, and a residual generator R(·),\n  \\[\n  \\tilde{x} = x + U\\!\\left(R\\!\\left(S(x),\\, \\psi(\\omega)\\right)\\right),\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\omega \\in \\{0,1\\}^l\\) is the bit payload and \\(\\psi\\) maps bits to a spatial tensor aligned to the downscaled image. Intuitively, embedding at low resolution concentrates the watermark into coherent, scalable structures that remain detectable after resizing/compression while minimizing high-res compute and artifacts.\n- Robust Top-k Noiser Optimization: Let \\(\\Phi = \\{\\Phi_i\\}_{i=1}^n\\) be a set of image transformations (compression, color/geometry, noise). Watermark robustness is trained via a top-k worst-case objective evaluated every T steps:\n  \\[\n  L_r(\\omega,\\tilde{\\omega}) = \\mathrm{BCE}\\!\\left(\\omega, D(\\tilde{x})\\right) + \\max_{I \\subset [n],\\,|I|=k} \\sum_{i\\in I} \\gamma_i\\, \\mathrm{BCE}\\!\\left(\\omega, D(\\Phi_i(\\tilde{x}))\\right),\n  \\]\n  with \\(\\gamma_i=0.5\\). This focuses optimization on the hardest current distortions without incurring full minimax cost each step, empirically improving resilience to aggressive crops (≤25% area), rotations (≤10°), JPEG, and color/blur/noise.\n- Multi-term Image Quality Loss in YUV with Perceptual and Frequency Regularization: Image fidelity is optimized at downscaled resolution via\n  \\[\n  L_q(x,\\tilde{x}) = \\beta_{\\text{YUV}} \\| \\mathrm{YUV}(S(x)) - \\mathrm{YUV}(S(\\tilde{x})) \\|_2^2 + \\beta_{\\text{LPIPS}}\\, \\mathrm{LPIPS}(S(x), S(\\tilde{x})) + \\beta_{\\text{FFL}}\\, \\mathrm{FFL}(S(x), S(\\tilde{x})) + \\beta_{\\text{GAN}}\\, L_{\\text{WGAN}},\n  \\]\n  with \\(\\beta\\)-weights fixed to 1.0. \\(L_{\\text{WGAN}} = \\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{disc}}(S(x))]-\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{disc}}(S(\\tilde{x}))]\\) encourages realism; LPIPS preserves perceptual similarity; FFL attenuates frequency artifacts; YUV MSE penalizes color/luminance distortion. The overall objective is \\(L=\\alpha_q L_q + \\alpha_r L_r\\), where \\(\\alpha_q\\) is ramped to \\(\\alpha_{q,\\max}=10.0\\) across stages.\n- ConvNeXt-based Watermark Decoder: The decoder \\(D\\) is a ConvNeXt-base backbone with a final sigmoid-activated linear head of dimension \\(l\\), predicting \\(\\hat{\\omega}\\in(0,1)^l\\). The binary cross-entropy\n  \\[\n  \\mathrm{BCE}(\\omega,\\hat{\\omega}) = -\\sum_{i=1}^l \\big[\\omega_i \\log \\hat{\\omega}_i + (1-\\omega_i)\\log(1-\\hat{\\omega}_i)\\big]\n  \\]\n  trains precise bit recovery. LayerNorm and modern convolutional design yield stable gradients under heavy distortions and resolution scaling, outperforming BN-based ResNets in robustness.\n- Bit-Tensor Preprocessing for Geometric Resilience and Co-embedding: Bits are mapped via a linear layer to a 3D tensor, upsampled, and zero-padded to align with the downscaled image spatial dimensions. If the downscaled canvas is \\(h_s\\times w_s\\) with channels \\(c\\), \\(\\psi:\\{0,1\\}^l \\to \\mathbb{R}^{h_s\\times w_s\\times c}\\) controls the spatial distribution of watermark energy, improving tolerance to crops/rotations and enabling multi-watermark co-embedding for layered provenance and identity.\n- UUID + BCH Error-Corrected Payload and Success Rate Metric: A 128-bit UUID is augmented with BCH parity bits to form a 256-bit payload \\(l=256\\). Decoding success is defined as exact recovery of all UUID data bits after ECC correction. Let \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) be the BCH code and \\(\\hat{\\omega}\\) the raw decoder output; success indicator is\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{1}_{\\text{succ}} = \\mathbb{I}\\big[\\mathrm{Decode}_{\\mathcal{C}}(\\hat{\\omega}) = \\omega_{\\text{UUID}}\\big],\n  \\]\n  and the success rate is \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\text{succ}}]\\) over images/noises. This metric complements bit accuracy and reflects end-to-end utility for provenance lookup.\n\n**Experimental Context:**\nThe evaluation prioritizes imperceptibility and robustness at high resolutions for both AI-generated and non-AI-generated images. Imperceptibility is measured with PSNR and SSIM at original resolution; robustness is measured by per-bit accuracy and an ECC-aware success rate on a comprehensive suite of distortions (JPEG compression, color jitter, RGB shift, blur/noise, posterize, flips/rotations, perspective, random erasing, random resized crop) implemented in Kornia/torchvision with “medium” strengths. Baselines include TrustMark (resolution scaling), SSL (latent space watermarking), StegaStamp (noise-hardened encoding), and dwtDctSvd (classical frequency-domain watermarking). To stress differences under realistic conditions, experiments are run on 900 DIV2K images (2K resolution) and 900 DALL·E 3 images, with l=100-bit payloads for baseline comparisons and l=256-bit payloads for capacity studies.\n\nThe experimental philosophy is to demonstrate a favorable triad of capacity–imperceptibility–robustness at high resolution with model-agnostic, post-generation watermarking. Training uses 100k DALL·E 3 images and a three-stage schedule: (1) stabilize decoding (low \\(\\alpha_q\\)), (2) increase fidelity (\\(\\alpha_q\\to 10\\)), (3) activate robust optimization using top-k worst-case noises. Performance emphasizes near-perfect decoding on clean images and ≥97% bit accuracy under strong distortions, alongside PSNR≈51 and SSIM≈0.998 imperceptibility (100-bit payload). The capacity study shows PSNR≈48, SSIM≈0.997 with 256-bit payloads and ≥95% ECC success under most distortions, including worst-case resized crop and JPEG. Attack analyses quantify robustness versus image quality: adversarial/regen attacks remove watermarks only with substantial quality loss (bit accuracy collapses near PSNR≈25), and a proposed fingerprint-binding mitigation addresses forgery risks when attackers reapply residuals to new images.",
        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Algorithm:**\n- Replace single-resolution pixel-domain embedding with a resolution-scaled residual embedding pipeline: embed at a downscaled resolution and upsample residuals to the native resolution before additive composition.\n- Modify the encoder to a MUNIT-style generator with skip connections and multiple 1×1 convolutional post-processing blocks; the binary watermark is linearly projected to a spatial tensor, upsampled, zero-padded, and concatenated channel-wise with the downscaled cover image prior to residual generation.\n- Replace standard random-noise training with worst-case robust optimization: periodically select the top-k most destructive transformations from a predefined noise set and backpropagate through those distortions to harden the decoder.\n- Replace ResNet decoders with ConvNeXt-base (pretrained) and a final l-dimensional sigmoid head, improving stability (no BatchNorm) and recovery of subtle residual patterns at high resolution; compute image quality loss at low resolution to preserve imperceptibility and reduce training cost.\n\n**Key_Mechanism:**\n- Watermark residuals are learned at a lower spatial scale, where the encoder can allocate signal compactly and uniformly; upsampling preserves relative spatial layout, yielding robustness to resizing/cropping while minimizing high-frequency artifacts. 1×1 convolutions constrain channel mixing to reduce color artifacts while preserving fine detail via skip connections.\n- Robust optimization over worst-case distortions aligns the decoder’s decision boundary with the envelope of common manipulations; periodically selecting top-k attacks focuses capacity on failure modes, explaining the consistent >97% bit accuracy under challenging transformations.\n- Using ConvNeXt without BatchNorm removes training instabilities observed with ResNet decoders and strengthens sensitivity to weak residuals; YUV-space MSE, LPIPS, focal frequency loss, and WGAN together suppress perceptual and frequency-domain artifacts while aligning encoded images to the natural image manifold.\n\n**Mathematical_Formulation:**\n- Variables and operators:\n  - Cover image x ∈ [0,1]^{H×W×3}, downscale operator S_s(·) with factor s, upsample operator U_s(·) to size H×W.\n  - Watermark bits ω ∈ {0,1}^l;

final watermarked image is additive composition of upsampled residuals and the original image.\n\n- Decoding and objectives:\n  \\[\n  \\hat{\\omega} = \\sigma\\big(F_\\psi(\\tilde{x})\\big) \\in (0,1)^l,\\quad\n  L_{\\mathrm{BCE}}(\\omega,\\hat{\\omega}) = -\\sum_{j=1}^{l}\\Big[\\omega_j \\log \\hat{\\omega}_j + (1-\\omega_j)\\log(1-\\hat{\\omega}_j)\\Big].\n  \\]\n  Image quality loss (computed at low resolution):\n  \\[\n  L_q = \\beta_{\\text{YUV}} \\|YUV(x_s) - YUV(x_s + r_s)\\|_2^2 + \\beta_{\\text{LPIPS}}\\,\\mathrm{LPIPS}(x_s, x_s + r_s) + \\beta_{\\text{FFL}}\\,\\mathrm{FFL}(x_s, x_s + r_s) + \\beta_{\\text{GAN}}\\,L_{\\text{WGAN}},\n  \\]\n  with WGAN objective\n  \\[\n  L_{\\text{WGAN}} = \\mathbb{E}_{x_s}[D_\\phi(x_s)] - \\mathbb{E}_{\\tilde{x}_s}[D_\\phi(\\tilde{x}_s)] + \\lambda\\,\\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{x}_s}\\big(\\|\\nabla_{\\hat{x}_s}D_\\phi(\\hat{x}_s)\\|_2 - 1\\big)^2,\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\tilde{x}_s = x_s + r_s\\), \\(\\hat{x}_s\\) is sampled along lines between \\(x_s\\) and \\(\\tilde{x}_s\\).\n\n- Robust watermark recovery loss with top-k worst-case selection every T steps:\n  \\[\n  L_r = L_{\\mathrm{BCE}}(\\omega,\\hat{\\omega}) + \\max_{I \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,n\\},\\,|I|=k}\\ \\sum_{i \\in I}\\gamma_i\\,L_{\\mathrm{BCE}}\\big(\\omega,\\ \\sigma(F_\\psi(\\Phi_i(\\tilde{x})))\\big).\n  \\]\n  Overall training objective:\n  \\[\n  \\min_{\\theta,\\psi}\\ \\alpha_q L_q + \\alpha_r L_r,\\quad \\max_{\\phi}\\ L_{\\text{WGAN}}.\n  \\]\n\n- Complexity (per iteration, batch size B):\n  - Encoder at low resolution: O(B·h'·w'·C_e·K^2) for K×K spatial kernels; 1×1 blocks add O(B·h'·w'·C_e^2).\n  - Upsampling and additive composition: O(B·H·W).\n  - Decoder at full resolution: O(B·H·W·C_d·K_d^2).\n  - Distortion evaluation for n noises (selection step every T iterations): O(B·n·H·W) forward-only; then train with k selected noises adds k×decoder/forward-backprop cost.\n\n**Computational_Properties:**\n- Time Complexity:\n  - Training (per iteration excluding selection): O(B·h'·w'·C_e·K^2 + B·H·W + B·H·W·C_d·K_d^2) + O(k·B·H·W·C_d·K_d^2) due to k distortions.\n  - Selection step (every T iters): O(B·n·H·W·C_d·K_d^2) forward passes; amortized overhead O((n/T)·B·H·W·C_d·K_d^2).\n  - Inference (encode+decode, no noise): O(B·h'·w'·C_e·K^2 + B·H·W + B·H·W·C_d·K_d^2).\n\n- Space Complexity:\n  - Encoder activations at low resolution: O(B·h'·w'·C_e·L_e) where L_e is #layers.\n  - Decoder activations at full resolution: O(B·H·W·C_d·L_d).\n  - Additional buffers for upsampled residuals and distortions: O(B·H·W).\n  - Overall peak memory dominated by decoder at full resolution; training benefits from computing L_q at low resolution.\n\n- Parallelization:\n  - All convolutions, upsampling, and pointwise activations are highly parallelizable on GPUs; distortions Φ_i are vectorized with Kornia/torchvision and can be batched across k attacks.\n  - Top-k selection over n noises is data-parallel; per-noise forward passes can be pipelined or distributed across devices.\n\n- Hardware Compatibility:\n  - GPU-friendly memory access patterns (contiguous NHWC/NCHW tensors) for convolution and upsampling; optimized libraries (cuDNN) accelerate ConvNeXt and MUNIT.\n  - CPU inference feasible for small images or low s (aggressive downscaling), but full-resolution decoding favors GPU due to large H·W.\n  - Memory bandwidth requirements increase with H·W; mixed precision (FP16/BF16) recommended to reduce footprint.\n\n- Training vs. Inference:\n  - Training adds discriminator and robust noise branches (k) increasing time and memory; inference omits GAN and Φ_i branches, reducing cost.\n  - Three-stage schedule (decoder-first, reconstruction, robustness) stabilizes optimization by gradually increasing α_q and deferring worst-case distortions.\n\n- Parameter Count:\n  - Encoder parameters depend on MUNIT blocks and 1×1 conv widths; linear watermark projector Π adds O(l·C_w·h'·w') parameters.\n  - Decoder uses ConvNeXt-base with a final l-dim sigmoid head; head adds O(l·C_{final}) parameters. Removing BatchNorm avoids extra affine stats.\n  - Discriminator adds modest parameters relative to decoder; overall model size dominated by ConvNeXt-base.\n\n- Numerical Stability:\n  - No BatchNorm in ConvNeXt avoids batch-size-dependent instabilities; sigmoid+BCE on l bits is numerically stable with label smoothing if needed.\n  - WGAN-GP improves discriminator stability; FFL reduces ringing/aliasing by penalizing undesirable frequency components; computing L_q in YUV mitigates color-shift artifacts.\n  - Top-k max selection introduces non-smoothness; amortizing selection every T steps keeps gradients well-behaved while focusing training on hard cases.\n\n- Scaling Behavior:\n  - Larger images (H,W) increase decoder cost linearly in pixels; encoder cost scales with h',w' (lower due to s), preserving imperceptibility at high resolution.\n  - Payload size l scales projector Π linearly; decoding head scales linearly with l; empirical robustness maintained up to 256 bits with BCH ECC.\n  - Increasing s (stronger downscale) reduces encoder compute and artifacts but may reduce fine-grained localization; s should balance imperceptibility and robustness to crops/rotations.\n  - Number of noises n and selected k trade off training time with robustness; typical settings (medium-level distortions, k=2) yield >97% bit accuracy across manipulations.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "Integration_Strategy:\n- Overall pipeline insertion:\n  - Post-generation watermarking: place the encoder immediately after image synthesis/save in your pipeline. For SD/DALL·E or any renderer, call Encoder.forward(x, ω) to get residuals at low resolution, upsample, and add to original x to obtain x̃. Decoding happens downstream via Decoder.forward(x̃) at provenance check time.\n  - Modules to add/modify:\n    - Encoder E: implement a MUNIT-style U-Net with skip connections and a terminal stack of 1×1 convolutions for fidelity. Input: concatenation of low-res image and watermark tensor; Output: low-res residuals.\n    - Watermark preprocessing: replace the bit string ω ∈ {0,1}^l by a learnable projection: Linear(l → Cw·H′·W′), reshape to [B, Cw, H′, W′], upsample to target low-res size, zero-pad to match the downscaled image. Concatenate with the downscaled image channels along C.\n    - Resolution scaling: downscale cover image x to H′×W′ by bicubic; encoder operates at H′×W′; predicted residuals are then upscaled (bicubic) to H×W and added to x with per-pixel clipping.\n    - Decoder D: use ConvNeXt-base with pre-trained weights; remove final classifier; add AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1) followed by Linear(1024 → l) with sigmoid activation per bit.\n    - Noiser Φ: inject image transforms module after encoding, and before decoding, during training only. Use Kornia for all transforms except JPEG (torchvision.io).\n    - Discriminator (WGAN): add a PatchGAN-style discriminator trained at low resolution H′×W′ on real vs watermarked images for LGAN.\n  - Code-level changes (PyTorch):\n    - Class WatermarkPreprocess(nn.Module): self.fc = nn.Linear(l, Cw*H′*W′); forward: normalize ω to {0,1} floats, project, reshape, upsample with interpolate(mode='bilinear'), pad with F.pad to match H′×W′; return tensor wmap of shape [B, Cw, H′, W′].\n    - Class Encoder(nn.Module): MUNIT-like blocks: Downsample ×N (Conv→IN→ReLU), Residual Blocks ×M, Upsample ×N; add skip connections; final Conv1x1 stack: e.g., Conv1x1→GELU→Conv1x1→tanh or identity; forward returns residuals r′ at H′×W′.\n    - Class ResolutionScaler: forward(x, r′) → upsample r′ to H×W, optional per-channel scaling s ∈ R^3 (learnable or fixed), x̃ = clamp(x + r, 0, 1).\n    - Class DecoderConvNeXt: load timm ‘convnext_base’; replace head with new l-dim sigmoid head; ensure AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1) used.\n    - Class Noiser: Compose list of Kornia augmentations per Table 1; implement selection of top-k hardest transforms; cache selection for 200 steps.\n    - Losses: Implement YUV MSE (convert RGB → YUV with fixed matrix), LPIPS (torchmetrics or lpips package; normalize to [-1,1]), Focal Frequency Loss (ffl from public repo), WGAN-GP (optional gradient penalty).\n    - Training loop: 3-phase schedule toggling αq and noise application; reevaluate hardest noises every 200 steps; store indices I of selected transforms.\n  - Framework compatibility:\n    - PyTorch primary; TensorFlow/JAX: replace Kornia with tf.image/ImgAug equivalent; LPIPS and FFL have TF/JAX ports; ConvNeXt available in tf.keras/applications or flax/timm variants; ensure adaptive pooling or global mean on arbitrary resolutions.\n  - Migration path:\n    - From TrustMark: reuse resolution scaling and JPEG/noise stack; swap their decoder with ConvNeXt-base to stabilize training (no BatchNorm); adopt robust optimization (top-k worst noise) instead of random sampling; add 1×1 post-processing stack to encoder.\n    - From StegaStamp/HiDDen: keep their U-Net encoder, but introduce low-res residual prediction and upscaling; replace decoder with ConvNeXt-base; port noise/transforms to Kornia.\n  - Dependencies:\n    - PyTorch ≥ 2.1; timm ≥ 0.9 for ConvNeXt; Kornia ≥ 0.7; torchvision for JPEG; lpips; focal-frequency-loss (FFL) implementation; CUDA/cuDNN; optional bchlib (or reedsolo) for BCH ECC; C2PA SDK for manifest integration.\n  - Training pipeline integration:\n    - Mixed precision (torch.cuda.amp); DDP for multi-GPU; gradient accumulation for large images; gradient clipping (global norm 1.0–2.0).\n    - Logging of PSNR/SSIM and bit accuracy per noise; store top-k noise selections; visualize residuals ×20 amplification for QC.\n\nParameter_Settings:\n- Model/data scales:\n  - Image resolution H×W:\n    - 1024×1024: set H′×W′ = 256–384 (scale factor s ≈ 3–4).\n    - 2K (2048×2048): H′×W′ = 384–512 (s ≈ 4–5).\n    - 4K (4096×4096): H′×W′ = 640–768 (s ≈ 5–6).\n  - Choose s to keep residual energy low and decoder robust; larger s increases imperceptibility but may reduce robustness to small crops; smaller s increases robustness but risks visible artifacts.\n- Payload:\n  - l = 100 for baseline; l = 256 for UUID+ECC. For 256, use 128-bit UUID + 128 bits ECC (suggest BCH(255,131,t ∈ [10,15]) packed to 256 bits; pad/truncate deterministically; verify ECC decode at inference).\n- Encoder:\n  - Channels: base C = 64; Cw (watermark channels) = 8–16.\n  - Downsample blocks N = 3; Residual blocks M = 4–6; Upsample blocks N = 3.\n  - Post 1×1 stack length: 2–3 layers; final activation linear; residual scaling factor λr ∈ [0.05, 0.2]; start at 0.2 and cosine decay to 0.08 over training.\n  - Initialization: Kaiming normal for convs; Linear fc init std = 0.02; set bias to 0.\n- Decoder:\n  - ConvNeXt-base; head: Linear(1024 → l), sigmoid; initialize with Xavier uniform (gain=1.0); no BatchNorm anywhere; use EMA on decoder weights (decay 0.999) to stabilize.\n- Loss weights:\n  - αq schedule: stage 1: αq = 0.1–0.5; stage 2 ramp to αq,max = 10.0 over 20–40% of total steps; stage 3 keep αq = 10.0.\n  - αr = 1.0 throughout.\n  - βYUV = βLPIPS = βFFL = βGAN = 1.0 (as per paper).\n  - γi = 0.5 for noise-weighted BCE; k = 2 top worst noises; reevaluate every 200 steps.\n- Noise/transforms (training/eval; Kornia unless noted):\n  - JPEG (torchvision.io): q ∈ {50, 75, min quality}; use fixed bounds rather than random uniform in range; recommended q in [50, 95] for training; extreme q=50 for eval.\n  - Brightness, Contrast, Saturation: use lower/upper bounds only: [0.75, 1.25].\n  - Gaussian blur: kernel k ∈ {5}; σ ∈ [0.1, 1.5].\n  - Gaussian noise: std = 0.04 (relative to [0,1] scale).\n  - Posterize: bits = 4.\n  - ColorJiggle: bri=0.1, con=0.1, sat=0.1, hue=0.02.\n  - RGB shift: shift_limit = 0.05.\n  - Flip: prob = 1.0 (horizontal).\n  - Rotation: deg ∈ [0, 10].\n  - RandomErasing: scale ∈ [0.02, 0.1], ratio ∈ [0.5, 1.5].\n  - Perspective: scale = 0.1.\n  - RandomResizedCrop: scale ∈ [0.75, 1.0], ratio ∈ [0.75, 1.33]; simulate up to 25% area crop.\n- Optimization:\n  - Encoder LR: 1e-4 to 3e-4 (AdamW, betas 0.9/0.999, weight decay 1e-4).\n  - Decoder LR: 1e-4 to 2e-4 (AdamW); discriminator LR: 1e-4.\n  - Warmup: 2–5% of total steps; cosine decay thereafter.\n  - Batch size: 8–16 at 2K resolution on 40GB GPU; gradient accumulation to reach effective batch 32.\n  - AMP (fp16/bf16): bf16 preferred on Hopper; fp16 on Ampere; enable autocast for conv-heavy ops and disable for LPIPS/FFL if unstable.\n- Critical vs robust parameters:\n  - Critical: αq schedule, s (resolution scale), k and reevaluation interval for top-k noises, decoder architecture (no BN), residual scaling λr.\n  - Robust: number of residual blocks, exact β per loss (keep at 1.0), precise color jitter bounds (small variations ok).\n- Hardware-dependent settings:\n  - A100 40GB: H′=512 for 2K images; batch 16; AMP bf16; DDP across 8 GPUs; enable cudnn.benchmark.\n  - RTX 3090 24GB: H′=384 for 2K images; batch 8–12; AMP fp16; gradient checkpointing in encoder/decoder.\n  - CPU-only decoding: resize to H′=256; expect 0.5–1.5 s per image; avoid LPIPS during inference.\n\nApplication_Conditions:\n- Beneficial scenarios:\n  - High-resolution image provenance for AI-generated and natural photos (≥1024×1024), where metadata can be stripped and exact ID retrieval is required.\n  - Payload needs ≥100 bits; optimal at 256 bits for UUID + ECC.\n  - Robustness against common social media manipulations: JPEG recompression (q ≥ 50), color/contrast tweaks, slight blur/noise, small rotations (≤10°), small crops (≤25% area).\n- Hardware requirements:\n  - Training: multi-GPU recommended (≥2×24–40GB GPUs) for 2K images; minimum single 24GB GPU with accumulation; storage for 100k images (~200–400GB).\n  - Inference (encoding/decoding): single 8–16GB GPU sufficient for 2K images; CPU feasible for decoding at lower throughput.\n- Scale considerations:\n  - Training dataset size: ≥50k diverse images for robust decoder generalization; 100k ideal (as in paper).\n  - Image resolution: imperceptibility benefits increase with higher resolution due to residual energy distribution; 2K–4K images yield best PSNR/SSIM.\n- Task compatibility:\n  - Best for provenance retrieval (exact ID match) and C2PA soft-binding. Neutral for tasks needing visible marks. Not intended for adversarial detection or watermark removal.\n- Alternative comparisons:\n  - Prefer InvisMark over TrustMark when larger payload (256 bits) and higher imperceptibility (PSNR ~48–51) is required. Prefer TrustMark if you need a lighter decoder or lower compute.\n  - Avoid SSL latent watermarking if JPEG/ColorShift robustness is critical; InvisMark shows stronger performance under these noises.\n- Resource constraints:\n  - If memory-limited, reduce H′ and batch size; use ConvNeXt-tiny for decoder (trade some robustness).\n  - If compute-limited, skip WGAN loss (LGAN) and rely on YUV+LPIPS+FFL; expect slight drop in imperceptibility.\n\nExpected_Outcomes:\n- Performance improvements (compared to baselines):\n  - Imperceptibility: PSNR ≈ 51.4 and SSIM ≈ 0.998 for 100-bit payload on 2K images; for 256-bit payload PSNR ≈ 47.8–47.9, SSIM ≈ 0.997.\n  - Robustness: bit accuracy ≥97–100% across common transforms (Gaussian blur/noise, color jitter, posterize, RGB shift, rotation ≤10°, small crops). JPEG q≈50 yields ≥97% for 256-bit, ≥99% for 100-bit on AI/non-AI datasets.\n  - Decoding success (with BCH): near 100% across most transforms; ≥90–99% under hardest cases (random resized crop, JPEG q≈50) for 256-bit UUID+ECC.\n- Timeline expectations:\n  - Stage 1 (decoder pre-training/emphasis): 20–30% of total steps; observe rapid rise in clean bit accuracy to >99%.\n  - Stage 2 (increase αq): next 30–40%; PSNR climbs to target; clean robustness still high.\n  - Stage 3 (robust optimization): final 30–40%; hard-noise accuracy converges to ≥97%.\n  - Total wall-clock: 2–5 days on 8×A100 for 100k dataset; 5–8 days on 2×3090.\n- Trade-offs:\n  - Larger payload slightly reduces PSNR/SSIM and increases residual energy; faint color-striping residuals may be visible in flat areas (clear sky) at high amplification; mitigate via residual color uniformity regularization or λr decay.\n  - Robust optimization late in training improves noise resilience but can slow convergence; early introduction may destabilize training.\n- Benchmark comparisons:\n  - Expect consistent outperformance vs TrustMark, SSL, StegaStamp, dwtDctSvd on robustness table (Table 3) with near-perfect clean/noise accuracies, especially Gaussian blur and color jigs.\n- Failure modes:\n  - Advanced removal attacks (VAE/diffusion regeneration and adversarial optimization) will drop bit accuracy to random when PSNR < ~25–30; above PSNR ~30, InvisMark maintains high accuracy.\n  - Geometry-heavy manipulations beyond training bounds (rotation > 10°, crops > 25% area) reduce accuracy; extend Φ with stronger transforms to counter.\n  - Training instability if BN used in decoder (avoid BN; ConvNeXt has LayerNorm); LPIPS scaling mistakes (ensure inputs normalized to [-1,1]).\n- Debugging indicators:\n  - Residual visualization ×20 should show low-amplitude, structured but not blotchy artifacts; large patches or color banding indicate too small s or too high λr.\n  - PSNR distribution peaks near 50–52 (100-bit) and 47–49 (256-bit); SSIM near 0.997–0.999.\n  - Bit accuracy vs PSNR under attacks: expect sharp drop only when PSNR < 30; otherwise clustered near 1.0.\n  - Top-k selection: monitor selected noises; if always the same, expand noise diversity or reevaluation interval.\n- Hardware-specific outcomes:\n  - On A100/H100 with bf16, expect +10–20% throughput and stable mixed precision; LPIPS/FFL compute slightly faster.\n  - On consumer GPUs, AMP fp16 may cause LPIPS instability; compute LPIPS in fp32.\n\nQuality Requirements:\n- Troubleshooting guidance:\n  - Visible artifacts in flat regions: increase s (downscale more), reduce λr by 10–30%, add frequency-domain regularization (raise βFFL to 1.5), or introduce color uniformity penalty on residuals (L2 over chroma channels).\n  - Poor robustness to rotation/crop: increase k to 3; add stronger Rotation (up to 15°) and larger RandomResizedCrop (scale down to 0.65) in late training; ensure watermark tensor spatial distribution spans entire H′×W′.\n  - Decoder overfitting: add EMA, weight decay 1e-4, randomize noise application order; increase dataset diversity.\n  - LPIPS mis-scaling: confirm input normalization to [-1,1]; use lpips.VGG network; freeze LPIPS model parameters.\n  - JPEG implementation: torchvision io uses YUV; ensure consistent color space during PSNR/SSIM computation.\n- Validation procedures:\n  - Compute PSNR/SSIM on original resolution, bit accuracy per transform; target ≥97% across Table 1 noises; log distributions (as in Figure 3).\n  - Attack validation: run AdvEmbG-KLVAE8 and SD2.1 regeneration with varying steps; verify bit accuracy vs PSNR curve (fail below PSNR 25–30).\n  - Forgery mitigation: bind watermark to image fingerprint (perceptual hash + robust embedding), store in C2PA manifest; on decode, retrieve UUID, lookup fingerprint in DB, compare to current image fingerprint (reject on mismatch).\n- Software/hardware dependencies:\n  - Ensure Kornia and torchvision versions produce deterministic transforms under DDP; seed kornia RNG per process.\n  - Enable cudnn.benchmark for speed; disable for strict determinism.\n  - Use bchlib or reedsolo for ECC; validate end-to-end encoding/decoding with random bit flips injected to simulate errors."
