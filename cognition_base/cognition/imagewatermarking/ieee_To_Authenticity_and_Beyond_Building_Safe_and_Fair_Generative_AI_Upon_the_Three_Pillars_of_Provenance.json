        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_HIGH: [Triadic Provenance Stack – Watermark-Triggered Deterministic Lookup Bound to Signed Manifests via Learned Fingerprints]\nThis architecture replaces single-technology provenance (metadata-only, watermark-only, or fingerprint-only) with a tightly integrated triad that changes how recovery and verification of provenance is computed at web scale. Instead of passively probing every image with approximate search, an invisible watermark acts as an explicit “interrupt” that deterministically routes the client to the correct manifest, while a learned visual fingerprint bound inside the signed manifest closes the spoofing/stripping attack surface.\n\nThe key mechanism is a client-side pipeline: detect a watermark and extract a short payload ID; perform a constant-time lookup of that ID via a distributed ledger key–value store to obtain a manifest endpoint and manifest ID; retrieve a C2PA-signed manifest; then verify by comparing the learned fingerprint stored in the manifest against the query image’s fingerprint. Formally, the acceptance check can be implemented via a learned comparator \\(ICN(\\cdot,\\cdot)\\) or a cosine threshold \\(\\cos(f_q, f_m) \\ge \\tau\\), where \\(f_q\\) is the fingerprint of the query image and \\(f_m\\) is the fingerprint recorded inside the signed manifest. Binding occurs because the manifest is PKI-signed and includes both a hard pixel hash and the soft fingerprint key, making spoofed payloads fail the visual check.\n\nThe fundamental difference from prior approaches is the decoupling of “trigger” and “verification”: watermark presence provides deterministic routing and reduces retrieval from approximate nearest-neighbor search over a large index (typical \\(O(\\log N)\\) with sharded ANN) to an \\(O(1)\\) key–value resolution on a proof-of-stake DLT, while authenticity is assured by a PKI-bound, fingerprint-verified manifest. Unlike secrecy-based watermark systems, detection/encoding is public and open-sourced; robustness is achieved by binding the watermark payload to content via the signed manifest’s fingerprint rather than encrypting the payload. Federated, decentralized resolution (e.g., Polygon smart-contract K–V: watermarkID \\(\\rightarrow\\) (manifestID, endpoint)) eliminates a single point of trust and scales to high-throughput writes (\\(\\sim10^5\\) pairs/s) and low-cost reads, as depicted in the end-to-end workflow (browser extension → DLT → repository → visual check).\n\n\n### DESIGN_INSIGHT_MEDIUM: [Contrastive Editorial Sensitivity Fingerprinting – CNN Embeddings with Two-Stage Verification for Robust Decoupled Metadata Recovery]\nThis module replaces brittle cryptographic hashes (which require exact pixel matches) and legacy perceptual hashes with a learned convolutional embedding that is invariant to noneditorial renditions yet sensitive to editorial edits, enabling reliable recovery of stripped or substituted provenance metadata. It modifies the fingerprinting stage by training a ResNet encoder to produce compact embeddings that can survive resizing, format/quality changes, and platform-induced degradations while rejecting edited content.\n\nLet \\(f_i = E(x_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{7 \\times 7 \\times 256}\\) be the feature map from encoder \\(E\\). The contrastive objective enforces similarity under noneditorial augmentation \\(\\tilde{f}_i\\) and dissimilarity across the batch, with an additional negated term for editorial augmentations to induce sensitivity:\n\\[\nL_C \\;=\\; \\sum_{i \\in B} \\log \\frac{d(f_i,\\tilde{f}_i)}{d(f_i,\\tilde{f}_i) + \\sum_{j \\ne i,\\, j \\in B} d(f_i,f_j)} \\quad\\text{with}\\quad\nd(a,b) := \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{a^\\top b}{\\|a\\|\\,\\|b\\|}\\Big),\n\\]\nplus an identical but negated term using editorial augmentations \\(\\tilde{f}_i^{(\\text{edit})}\\) to penalize unwanted invariance. Embeddings are projected and quantized to create a soft-binding key, enabling ANN retrieval from a sharded index to produce a shortlist.\n\nThe fundamental difference from prior single-stage retrieval is a learned pairwise verification via an Image Comparator Network (ICN) applied on the shortlist. Rather than thresholding raw embedding distances, the ICN learns a nonlinear decision over \\((f_q, f_c)\\) pairs, significantly reducing false positives at scale and hardening against adversarial collisions. Complexity-wise, the triaged pipeline converts a full-index scan to \\(O(\\log N)\\) (or sublinear ANN) for shortlisting, followed by \\(O(k)\\) pairwise ICN checks, and finally a deterministic decision. This enables practical, near real-time recovery of content credentials for millions of daily generative outputs, while preserving editorial-change sensitivity that prevents misattribution of altered images to original manifests.\n\n\n### DESIGN_INSIGHT_MEDIUM: [TrustMark Universal Watermarking – Encoder–Decoder with Noise Simulator and Composite Perceptual Loss for Open, Robust Payloads]\nThis system replaces brittle, secrecy-based watermarking with a public, resolution-agnostic learned embedder/extractor that is robust to typical platform renditions and supports iterative rewatermarking in creative workflows. The embedder predicts a residual that is blended into the image at user-selectable strength, while a noise simulator exposes the watermark to 18 realistic degradation sources during training, ensuring payload recovery without sacrificing image quality.\n\nGiven image \\(x\\) and watermarked output \\(y\\), the training objective balances imperceptibility and recovery:\n\\[\nL_{\\text{total}}(x,y) \\;=\\; \\alpha\\,L_{\\text{quality}}(x,y) \\;+\\; L_{\\text{recovery}}(w,\\tilde{w}),\n\\]\nwhere \\(L_{\\text{recovery}}\\) is binary cross-entropy over bits between embedded payload \\(w\\) and extracted \\(\\tilde{w}\\), and\n\\[\nL_{\\text{quality}}(x,y) \\;=\\; \\beta_{\\text{YUV}}\\,L_{\\text{YUV}} \\;+\\; \\beta_{\\text{LPIPS}}\\,L_{\\text{LPIPS}} \\;+\\; \\beta_{\\text{FFL}}\\,L_{\\text{FFL}} \\;+\\; \\beta_{\\text{GAN}}\\,L_{\\text{GAN+GP}}.\n\\]\nThe focal-frequency term biases residual energy toward lower frequencies for robustness, while the GAN+GP discriminator discourages perceivable artifacts. A remover module enables erase-and-reapply workflows; BCH error correction trades payload capacity for reliability (e.g., 96% bit accuracy requires 28 parity bits, leaving \\(2^{72}\\) unique IDs).\n\nUnlike prior closed or secret-key designs, TrustMark’s open encoder/decoder acknowledges strippability and spoofing risks and counters them at the system level by binding payload IDs to PKI-signed manifests and verifying via learned fingerprints. Operationally, watermark detection reduces metadata recovery from probabilistic ANN search to deterministic ID resolution; practically, image quality remains in an acceptable creative range (\\(\\sim\\)45 dB PSNR) while maintaining payload robustness across typical web renditions.",

fewer visible artifacts detected by GAN-based discriminator; improved robustness under JPEG recompression and resizing.",
        "BACKGROUND": "Title: To Authenticity, and Beyond! Building Safe and Fair Generative AI Upon the Three Pillars of Provenance\n\nHistorical Technical Context:\n- Prior to this work, authenticity and provenance in visual media largely relied on two families of approaches. First, digital forensics and detection methods developed alongside classical computer vision and deep learning—CNN-based manipulation detectors, frequency-domain artifacts analysis, and later adversarially trained discriminators—aimed to classify content as “manipulated” or “synthetic.” Second, metadata-based systems (EXIF, XMP) and public key infrastructure (PKI) provided file-level context (who, when, where), but were fragile to stripping and substitution as content flows through platforms. In parallel, steganography and watermarking advanced from hand-crafted transforms (DWT/DCT/SVD) to learned, robust invisible watermarking (e.g., RivaGAN, StegaStamp, RoSteaLS), trading off payload capacity against imperceptibility and robustness.\n- The rise of Generative AI (diffusion models, GANs, and transformer-based text-to-image systems) dramatically democratized content creation but also lowered the barrier to misuse, amplifying misinformation and misattribution. This motivated the C2PA open standard for signed, verifiable provenance manifests (“Content Credentials”) and the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI). However, platform renditions (resizing, reformatting, quality changes) and legacy pipelines routinely strip or decouple metadata, exposing vulnerabilities. At the same time, large-scale deployment constraints (browser-side verification, privacy, and network load) necessitated complementary passive identification signals (perceptual hashing/fingerprints) and active signals (invisible watermarks) to trigger deterministic lookup and bind assets to provenance.\n- Finally, the problem space evolved beyond authenticity to encompass synthetic media provenance and creator agency: training consent, attribution to training data, and compensation. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and NFTs introduced decentralized ownership provenance, but lacked integrated rights/licensing and practical attribution. This work integrates a triad—signed metadata (C2PA), robust fingerprinting, and universal watermarking (TrustMark)—with decentralized lookup (Polygon-based K–V registry) and an Ownership–Rights–Attribution (ORA) framework, addressing end-to-end trust, attribution, and value transfer in the creative economy.\n\nTechnical Limitations:\n- Metadata decoupling and substitution: C2PA manifests can be stripped or replaced during platform renditions; without a network-verified binding, a cryptographic hash of pixels is brittle under noneditorial transformations. Challenge: robustly re-link assets to signed manifests despite format, size, and quality changes.\n- Passive lookup scalability and privacy: Pure fingerprint-based recovery requires querying every image lacking visible metadata, imposing high client/network load and potential privacy concerns. Complexity: naive nearest-neighbor over N assets is O(ND) in embedding dimension D; at web scale, even approximate search requires sharding and verification layers.\n- Robust watermarking under open detection: Invisible watermarks must be publicly decodable client-side, making them susceptible to stripping and spoofing (insertion/copying). Payload capacity is limited (hundreds of bits), constraining direct storage of signatures or manifests; imperceptibility constraints target PSNR ≥ 40 dB.\n- False positive risk in fingerprint retrieval: Perceptual hashes must be invariant to noneditorial changes yet sensitive to editorial edits. Prior approaches suffered from attribution errors, necessitating learned comparators and adversarial training to reduce misretrievals. Deployment demands thresholdable, low-FP scoring at multi-million-image/day scale.\n- Decentralized resolution and throughput: A single global manifest repository is impractical; federated lookup requires a trusted indirection layer. DLT must support high write throughput (≈10^5 K–V/s) at low cost (<$0.001 per pair) and efficient public reads, while avoiding centralized trust and energy-intensive consensus.\n- Synthetic attribution granularity and causality: Correlation-based matching to training data can be approximate; causal signals are needed to link generated outputs to training subsets. Learned models memorize duplicated concepts; inducing regurgitation of cluster-level watermarks must balance memorization utility against training realism and watermark survivability.\n\nPaper Concepts:\n- Content Credentials (C2PA Manifest): A signed, verifiable data structure embedded in a media asset encoding provenance assertions and ingredients. Let x denote the image pixels and H be a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256). The manifest M contains a claim C with assertions A and a hard binding h = H(x). The claim is signed via PKI: σ = \\(\\mathrm{Sign}_{\\mathrm{priv}}(C \\,\\|\\, h)\\); verification checks \\(\\mathrm{Verify}_{\\mathrm{pub}}(\\sigma, C \\,\\|\\, h)\\) and recomputes H(x′) to ensure \\(H(x′) = h\\), binding the manifest to the content. Ingredients form a directed acyclic graph where nodes reference other manifests, enabling lineage tracing.\n- Contrastive Fingerprint Embedding: A CNN encoder E produces a robust perceptual fingerprint invariant to noneditorial renditions and sensitive to editorial edits. For image \\(x_i\\), \\(f_i = E(x_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{7 \\times 7 \\times 256}\\). Define cosine similarity \\(s(a,b) = \\frac{a^\\top b}{\\|a\\|\\,\\|b\\|}\\) and \\(d(a,b) = \\exp\\big(-(1 - s(a,b))\\big)\\). The InfoNCE-style objective over batch B:\n  \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_C = \\sum_{i \\in B} \\log \\frac{d(f_i, \\tilde{f}_i)}{d(f_i, \\tilde{f}_i) + \\sum_{j \\neq i,\\, j \\in B} d(f_i, f_j)}\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\tilde{f}_i = E(\\tilde{x}_i)\\) is an augmented (noneditorial) view of \\(x_i\\). An identical but negated term applies editorial augmentations to enforce sensitivity. Fingerprints are projected/quantized to compact keys for approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) retrieval.\n- Image Comparator Network (ICN): A learned pairwise verifier that reduces false positives by computing a nonlinear similarity score between query and candidate fingerprints. Let \\(s_\\theta(x_q, x_c) = \\mathrm{ICN}_\\theta(E(x_q), E(x_c)) \\in [0,1]\\). Matches from ANN are re-ranked and thresholded by \\(s_\\theta\\), producing a practical decision boundary \\(\\tau\\) minimizing FP at scale. ICN complements embedding-space distances with task-specific discrimination of editorial changes.\n- TrustMark Watermarking Loss: A universal watermarking framework with an embedder-decoder and noise simulator, balancing image quality and payload recovery. Given image x and payload \\(w \\in \\{0,1\\}^m\\), the embedder predicts residual r; the encoded image is \\(y = x + \\alpha r\\). The training objective:\n  \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{total}}(x,y) = a\\,\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{quality}}(x,y) + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{recovery}}(w,\\hat{w})\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{recovery}}\\) is binary cross-entropy on decoded bits \\(\\hat{w}\\), and\n  \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{quality}}(x,y) = b_{\\mathrm{YUV}}\\,L_{\\mathrm{YUV}}(x,y) + b_{\\mathrm{LPIPS}}\\,L_{\\mathrm{LPIPS}}(x,y) + b_{\\mathrm{FFL}}\\,L_{\\mathrm{FFL}}(x,y) + b_{\\mathrm{GAN}}\\,L_{\\mathrm{GAN+GP}}(x,y)\n  \\]\n  enforcing imperceptibility via YUV MSE, perceptual LPIPS, focal frequency regularization, and GAN+gradient penalty discrimination. Reported imperceptibility: PSNR ≈ 45.34 ± 1.33 dB with bit accuracy ≈ 96%.\n- BCH-encoded Watermark Payload: Error-corrected payload to ensure reliable recovery under platform noise. If the raw bit-flip rate is ≈4% (4 per 100), BCH adds 28 parity bits to correct such errors, leaving an effective identifier space of \\(2^{72}\\) unique IDs. Formally, payload \\(w\\) is encoded as \\(w' = \\mathrm{BCH}_k(w)\\), decoded as \\(\\hat{w} = \\mathrm{BCH}^{-1}_k(\\hat{w}')\\) provided error weight ≤ t(k).\n- DLT-based Decentralized Lookup: A key–value resolution layer on a proof-of-stake DLT (Polygon) mapping watermark IDs to manifest records. Define a registry \\(R:\\ \\mathrm{ID} \\mapsto (\\mathrm{mid}, \\mathrm{uri})\\), implemented as an append-only K–V smart contract. Performance: ≈ \\(10^5\\) writes/s, < $0.001 per K–V pair; high-throughput public reads via providers (e.g., Alchemy). Client workflow: detect watermark → resolve ID via \\(R\\) → fetch manifest → verify via fingerprint → display Content Credentials, enabling deterministic, federated recovery.\n\nExperimental Context:\n- Evaluation spans robustness, fidelity, scalability, and attribution. For watermarking, imperceptibility is measured by PSNR against originals (target ≥ 40 dB for creative acceptability) and bit recovery accuracy under a suite of 18 noise/rendition sources (resizing, compression, format transcodes, etc.). TrustMark reports ≈45.34 dB PSNR and ≈96% bit accuracy on benchmarks (e.g., METFACES-style), with BCH overhead quantified (28 parity bits for 4% flip rate).\n- Fingerprinting is validated at operational scale: millions of Adobe Firefly-generated images per day, with ANN retrieval over sharded OpenSearch indices followed by ICN verification to control false positives. The loss design demonstrates invariance to noneditorial transformations and sensitivity to editorial edits; performance is characterized by retrieval precision/recall under thresholding and robustness to adversarial spoofing. Decentralized lookup is assessed for throughput and cost on Polygon (proof-of-stake), while attribution studies demonstrate correlation-based matching to training data via dense patch fingerprints and causal cluster watermarking (ProMark), achieving attribution of up to \\(2^{12}\\) training concepts in a diffusion model trained on 1M images. The overall philosophy emphasizes authenticity and provenance reliability under real-world deployment constraints (browser-side decoding, privacy-aware selective lookups), favoring robustness and scalability over purely discriminative accuracy, and integrating decentralized consent and compensation mechanisms (ORA) tested via LoRA-style personalization workflows and micropayment issuance at generation time.",
        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "Core_Algorithm:\n- Replace unreliable in-file provenance (metadata alone) with a triad pipeline that integrates: (i) a robust, invisible watermark (TrustMark) carrying a short identifier; (ii) decentralized key–value resolution via a distributed ledger to locate a signed C2PA manifest; and (iii) a CNN-based perceptual fingerprint that is resilient to noneditorial renditions yet sensitive to editorial edits.\n- Compute a compact fingerprint embedding f(x) per image via a ResNet encoder trained with a contrastive objective under two augmentation regimes (noneditorial invariance vs editorial sensitivity), quantize it to a soft-binding key, and perform two-stage retrieval: fast ANN shortlist in a sharded OpenSearch vector index followed by pairwise verification using an Image Comparator Network (ICN).\n- On the client (browser extension), detect and decode the watermark; deterministically resolve the watermark ID to a manifest endpoint through a DLT K–V store; fetch the signed manifest; then antispoof by matching the query image’s fingerprint against the manifest’s stored fingerprint before displaying Content Credentials.\n- Train the TrustMark watermark embedder–extractor with a multi-term image-fidelity and bit-recovery loss under a rich noise simulator; apply BCH error correction to the payload to meet the required bit-accuracy at acceptable imperceptibility (≈45 dB PSNR). Deploy all client-side models via ONNX-quantized runtimes.\n\nKey_Mechanism:\n- The key insight is binding a publicly detectable, spoofable watermark to the actual pixels via a signed manifest that stores the image’s perceptual fingerprint; any mismatch between decoded ID and fingerprint similarity fails the antispoofing check. Thus, a small-capacity watermark triggers deterministic lookup while the robust fingerprint enforces visual consistency.\n- A contrastive training regime separates noneditorial changes (invariance) from editorial changes (sensitivity), enabling accurate reidentification after platform renditions while rejecting manipulated images. Decentralized K–V resolution removes single points of trust and scales federated manifest repositories.\n- Error-corrected payloads and a fidelity-regularized embedder maintain imperceptibility and resilience through common image operations; a two-stage retrieval (ANN + ICN) provides both scalability and strong false-positive suppression.\n\nMathematical_Formulation:\n- Perceptual fingerprint encoder and similarity:\n  Let x ∈ R^{H×W×3} be an image, E be a ResNet encoder producing a feature map f = E(x) ∈ R^{h×w×d}, flattened to u ∈ R^{F} with F = h·w·d, and normalized ū = u/∥u∥_2. Define scaled cosine kernel\n  \\( d(a,b) = \\exp\\big(\\gamma \\,\\frac{a^\\top b}{\\|a\\|_2\\,\\|b\\|_2}\\big) = \\exp\\big(\\gamma\\,\\cos(a,b)\\big) \\),\n  where γ > 0 is a temperature (sensitivity) parameter.\n\n- Contrastive objective with editorial/noneditorial augmentation:\n  For mini-batch B of size |B|, denote noneditorial augmentation by T^{ne} and editorial augmentation by T^{ed}. With u_i = \\text{vec}(E(x_i)), define u_i' = \\text{vec}(E(T^{ne}(x_i))) and \\tilde{u}_i = \\text{vec}(E(T^{ed}(x_i))). The InfoNCE-style objective is\n  \\[\n  \\mathcal{L}_C = -\\sum_{i\\in B} \\log \\frac{d(u_i,u_i')}{d(u_i,u_i') + \\sum_{j\\neq i} d(u_i,u_j')}\n  \\;+\\; \\sum_{i\\in B} \\log \\frac{\\sum_{j\\neq i} d(u_i,\\tilde{u}_j)}{d(u_i,\\tilde{u}_i) + \\sum_{j\\neq i} d(u_i,\\tilde{u}_j)} .\n  \\]\n  The first term enforces noneditorial invariance; the second (negated alignment) enforces editorial sensitivity.\n\n- Soft-binding key and verification:\n  Quantize u via random projections W ∈ R^{B×F} to produce a B-bit key\n  \\( q = \\operatorname{sign}(W\\,\\bar{u}) \\in \\{-1,+1\\}^{B} \\),\n  used for ANN retrieval of a shortlist {v_k} from the vector index. ICN computes a verification score s_k = \\sigma(g(\\bar{u},\\bar{v}_k)), where g is a learned comparator and σ is sigmoid; accept only if \\(\\max_k s_k \\ge \\tau\\) for threshold τ.\n\n- TrustMark watermark embedding and recovery:\n  The embedder predicts a residual R(x,w) for payload bitstring w ∈ {0,1}^P; the watermarked image is\n  \\( y = x + \\lambda \\, \\mathcal{U}\\big(R(x,w)\\big) \\),\n  where 𝒰 denotes upscaling and λ controls strength. The extractor yields \\(\\hat{w}\\). The training objective is\n  \\[\n  \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{total}}(x,y,w,\\hat{w}) = \\alpha\\,\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{quality}}(x,y) + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{recovery}}(w,\\hat{w}),\n  \\]\n  with\n  \\[\n  \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{quality}} = \\beta_{\\text{YUV}}\\,\\|x-y\\|_{\\text{YUV}}^2 + \\beta_{\\text{LPIPS}}\\,\\text{LPIPS}(x,y)\n  + \\beta_{\\text{FFL}}\\,\\text{FFL}(x,y) + \\beta_{\\text{GAN}}\\,\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{GAN+GP}}(x,y),\n  \\quad\n  \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{recovery}} = \\text{BCE}(w,\\hat{w}) .\n  \\]\n\n- Error correction and ID space:\n  Apply a BCH(n,m,t) code to payload: m data bits, r = n−m parity bits, correcting up to t bit flips. For ≈96% bit accuracy (≈4/100 flips), r ≈ 0.28 n; the usable ID space is \\(2^{m}\\) (e.g., \\(m\\approx 72\\) yields ≈\\(2^{72}\\) IDs).\n\nComputational_Properties:\n- Time Complexity:\n  - Fingerprint extraction: O(HW·C·K^2·L_e) per image for a CNN with L_e layers, channel width C, kernel size K (effectively linear in pixels with a constant from the architecture).\n  - ANN shortlist (vector index): O(B·log N) for tree/graph-based structures or amortized O(B + k) for HNSW/PQ; N is repository size, B is bit/key length, k is shortlist size.\n  - ICN verification: O(k·HW_v·C_v·K_v^2·L_v) where subscript v denotes ICN architecture.\n  - Watermark detect/extract: O(HW·C·K^2·L_x); embed: O(HW·C·K^2·L_e) including noise simulator passes.\n  - DLT resolution: O(1) expected (constant-time K–V read via provider API), plus manifest fetch latency.\n  Training adds: contrastive similarity across batch is O(|B|^2·F) if naively computed; implemented as a matrix multiply for O(|B|·F·|B|) with GPU-accelerated GEMM.\n\n- Space Complexity:\n  - Fingerprint vector per image: F floats; after quantization to B bits, storage per manifest is O(B) for the key plus O(F_q) for stored float fingerprint (if retained), where F_q ≤ F (e.g., 12,544 dims).\n  - Index: O(N·(B + overhead)) for ANN structure (HNSW graph typically adds O(N·M) edges).\n  - Watermark payload: O(n) bits per image; negligible compared to pixels. Models: embedder/extractor/ICN parameters dominate (tens of MB uncompressed; reduced with quantization).\n  - DLT K–V: O(N_ids) entries; on-chain storage is compact (tuple of manifest ID and endpoint URI).\n\n- Parallelization:\n  - Embedding and watermark inference fully data-parallel on GPU; batched across images.\n  - ANN search sharded across OpenSearch nodes; parallel queries per shard; ICN verification parallelized over shortlist.\n  - Training uses large batch contrastive losses leveraging GEMM and distributed data parallel; noise simulation streams augmentations on-the-fly.\n  - DLT reads are embarrassingly parallel; network I/O is the bottleneck.\n\n- Hardware Compatibility:\n  - GPU-friendly CNN workloads; ONNX runtime with 8-bit/16-bit quantization reduces memory bandwidth and improves CPU inference for browser clients.\n  - Fingerprint and ICN benefit from tensor cores; ANN index operations are CPU-side on server clusters (SIMD-optimized), or GPU-accelerated if supported.\n  - Watermarking residual blending is memory-bandwidth bound; YUV/LPIPS/FFL computations use vectorized kernels.\n\n- Training vs. Inference:\n  - Training includes adversarial discriminator (GAN + GP), noise simulator, and dual augmentation regimes; compute-heavy and best on multi-GPU.\n  - Inference path on client: watermark detect → DLT resolve → manifest fetch → single fingerprint forward + ICN verification; latency dominated by network and ANN query.\n\n- Parameter Count:\n  - Encoder E (e.g., ResNet-50) ≈ 25–26M params; ICN comparator typically 5–15M depending on depth; TrustMark embedder–extractor comparable to MUNIT content encoder–decoder (≈20–40M). Quantized client models can be reduced to a few MB each.\n\n- Numerical Stability:\n  - Use normalized vectors and temperature γ to prevent exp overflow; implement losses with log-sum-exp stabilization.\n  - BCE on bits uses label smoothing if needed for robustness; BCH corrects residual bit errors.\n  - GAN + GP regularizes discriminator; FFL encourages low-frequency residuals, mitigating ringing and improving watermark survivability.\n  - Threshold τ in verification chosen via ROC on validation; avoid overly tight thresholds to reduce false negatives on heavy renditions.\n\n- Scaling Behavior:\n  - Repository scale N: ANN search scales sublinearly with HNSW/PQ; sharding provides near-linear throughput with nodes.\n  - Image size H×W: inference cost scales linearly; quantization and tiling can cap memory for very large images.\n  - Payload length n: increasing n improves ID space but requires higher λ or sacrifices accuracy; BCH parity r grows with desired t, reducing usable m.\n  - Batch size |B| in training increases contrastive signal but quadratic similarity costs; mitigate with memory banks or sampled negatives.\n\nImplementation-critical details and pitfalls:\n- Carefully curate augmentation sets: T^{ne} should include resizing, compression, format changes, minor blur/noise; T^{ed} should include content edits (crop, paste, heavy retouch) to enforce sensitivity.\n- Quantization W must be fixed and reproducible; store the full-precision fingerprint in the signed manifest for robust verification.\n- Choose λ to meet PSNR ≥ 40 dB for creative acceptability; typical TrustMark achieves ≈45 dB at ≈96% bit accuracy with BCH (28% parity).\n- Protect against adversarial spoofing by requiring both: valid manifest signature (PKI) and fingerprint similarity ≥ τ; reject on either failure.\n- Deploy ONNX models with int8 quantization and per-channel scales to maintain extractor accuracy; validate on the same noise simulator used in training.",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "Integration_Strategy:\n- End-to-end triad pipeline (producer side → repository/DLT → verifier side):\n  1) ID generation\n     - Generate a globally unique content ID (CID) for each derived asset: 72–128 payload bits (before BCH) using UUIDv4 or crypto-grade PRNG.\n  2) Watermark first, then sign\n     - Embed the CID as TrustMark payload in the image before any hashing/signing.\n     - Rationale: C2PA’s mandatory hard binding hashes the final pixel bytes; any pixel edit post-signing invalidates the signature.\n  3) Fingerprint computation\n     - Compute the visual fingerprint embedding f(x) using the trained CNN encoder E (ResNet backbone). Persist the compact projected/quantized key for search.\n  4) Build and sign C2PA manifest\n     - Use the C2PA SDK to assemble a manifest containing:\n       - Claim assertions (creator/tool, timestamps, ingredients).\n       - The hard binding (pixel hash of the watermarked image).\n       - The visual fingerprint f(x) (store as a binary blob assertion with a schema/namespace you control).\n       - A unique manifest_id.\n     - Sign via PKI (X.509) using the organization’s private key (key length ≥ 3072-bit RSA or ECDSA P-256).\n  5) Store the manifest\n     - Put the manifest object into a manifest repository (REST endpoint), indexed by manifest_id, with a public read API.\n  6) Publish CID→manifest mapping on DLT\n     - Write a key-value pair to a Polygon PoS smart contract mapping: CID → (manifest_id, repo_endpoint_URI).\n     - Use a minimal ABI with mapping(bytesN => Record) where Record = {bytes manifest_id; string endpoint; uint64 createdAt}.\n     - Make contract append-only (no delete) and versioned writes (e.g., array of Records) to preserve history.\n  7) Distribution\n     - Distribute the watermarked + signed media. Downstream platforms may strip metadata; CID watermark persists.\n\n- Client-side verifier (browser extension or server-side ingestion):\n  1) Read C2PA\n     - Attempt C2PA extraction first. If present and signature verifies, display credentials; optionally cross-check watermark/fingerprint for consistency.\n  2) Watermark detect/decode\n     - If C2PA missing, run TrustMark extractor to detect presence and decode CID. If found, resolve via DLT: CID → (manifest_id, endpoint).\n  3) Fetch and verify manifest\n     - Download manifest from endpoint and verify signature and claim hash.\n  4) Anti-spoof visual check\n     - Compute f(x_query) and compare to f(x_manifest) stored in manifest using the Image Comparator Network (ICN). Accept if ICN score ≥ threshold (see Parameter_Settings).\n  5) Fallback passive search\n     - If no watermark or decoding fails, run passive fingerprint lookup against your OpenSearch index to find candidate manifests; re-rank/verify with ICN.\n\n- Code-level changes (PyTorch-first; TF/JAX analogous):\n  - Fingerprint encoder E\n    - Implement class FingerprintEncoder(nn.Module) wrapping a ResNet-50/101 trunk with 7×7×256 final feature map.\n    - Add ProjectionHead: Conv1×1(256→C), AvgPool(7×7), Flatten → L2-normalize. C ∈ {128, 256, 512}.\n    - Export ONNX for client inference; quantize to int8 with per-channel scales.\n  - Contrastive training\n    - TrainStep(images): aug_pos, aug_neg = noneditorial_aug(images), editorial_aug(images).\n    - f_pos = E(aug_pos); f_anchor = E(images); f_neg = E(aug_neg).\n    - Compute LC with cosine similarities and temperature τ; add explicit negated term for editorial sensitivity.\n  - ICN comparator\n    - Implement class ImageComparatorNet(nn.Module) taking pairs of embeddings (or small image crops) and outputting a match logit. Train with positive/negative pairs curated from retrieval candidates.\n  - TrustMark\n    - Embedder: Encoder–decoder CNN predicting residual; blend y = x + s·residual (clip to valid range).\n    - Extractor: Lightweight CNN mapping image → bit logits; apply sigmoid → bits; BCH decode.\n    - NoiseSim: differentiable module with 18 transforms (resize, JPEG, blur, noise, crop, color jitter, gamma, WebP-like quantization, etc.).\n  - C2PA SDK integration\n    - Add ManifestBuilder class to pipeline. Insert after watermarking. Populate assertions including fingerprint and ingredients. Sign with org key.\n  - DLT integration\n    - Write a thin service wrapping ethers.js/web3.py with retries and gas management; expose POST /mapCID to publish CID→(manifest_id, endpoint).\n  - Search backend\n    - OpenSearch with k-NN plugin (HNSW). Add endpoints: POST /search_fingerprint (vector), returns top-k manifest_ids.\n\n- Compatibility and migration:\n  - Existing export pipelines: Insert WatermarkEmbedder() immediately before the C2PA staging/signing step.\n  - Legacy content (no watermark): rely on fingerprint-only lookup; optionally backfill by re-encoding watermarks where permissible.\n  - Frameworks: PyTorch (1.13+), TF 2.9+, JAX 0.4+; ONNX Runtime (web): wasm/webgl/webgpu providers.\n  - No custom CUDA kernels required; rely on standard conv ops and OpenSearch ANN.\n\n- Dependencies/hardware features:\n  - Producer-side training/inference: GPUs with Tensor Cores (NVIDIA T4/A10/A100/L4/L40) for mixed precision; CPU-only inference viable for embedder at lower throughput.\n  - Client-side: ONNX Runtime Web with WebAssembly SIMD; optional WebGPU for sub-10 ms extraction.\n\nParameter_Settings:\n- Fingerprint encoder/training\n  - Backbone: ResNet-50 for balance; ResNet-101 if accuracy-critical.\n  - Output map: 7×7×256; projection C = 256 (small indexes) or 512 (large/open-world).\n  - Batch size B: 256–1024 on A100 40GB (fp16); 64–256 on 16GB GPUs.\n  - Learning rate: 1e-4 to 5e-4 (AdamW, β1=0.9, β2=0.999, weight_decay 1e-4).\n  - Temperature τ: 0.05–0.2; lower τ increases separation but can destabilize with small B.\n  - Augmentations:\n    - Noneditorial (invariance): resize [0.5–1.5×], JPEG Q in [50–95], mild blur σ∈[0.0–1.0], color jitter ±10%, gamma [0.9–1.1], WebP-like quant, small crops maintaining ≥85% area.\n    - Editorial (sensitivity): content-altering edits (object removal, heavy crop ≤60% area, inpaint, splice, text overlays).\n  - Projection quantization: 8-bit symmetric per-dim; or product quantization m=8, nbits=8 for large-scale indexes.\n\n- Search backend (OpenSearch HNSW)\n  - Vector dim: 256 or 512.\n  - Distance: cosine.\n  - HNSW parameters: M=32–48, efConstruction=300–800, efSearch=64–200.\n  - Shard sizing: 5–15M vectors/shard; replicate=2 for HA.\n  - Top-k: 50–200 for ICN recheck; start with k=100.\n\n- ICN verification\n  - Input: concatenated embeddings or cropped images (if available).\n  - Threshold: accept if ICN logit ≥ 0.90–0.95 (tune for target false positive rate 1e-6 to 1e-4 depending on risk tolerance).\n  - Training negatives: hard negatives from ANN shortlist + adversarially perturbed samples.\n\n- TrustMark watermarking\n  - Payload bits: 96–128 raw; with BCH( n,k ) allocate ~20–35% parity to correct up to 4% bit flips (paper: 28 bits parity for 4/100 flips; leaves 72-bit space ≈ 4.7e21 IDs).\n  - Strength s (residual blend): 0.005–0.02 (target PSNR ≥ 40 dB; TrustMark reports ≈45.3±1.3 dB at s near lower end).\n  - Loss weights:\n    - a (trade-off): 0.5–1.5 (higher emphasizes quality over recovery).\n    - bYUV=0.1–0.5, bLPIPS=0.5–1.0, bFFL=0.1–0.3, bGAN+GP=0.001–0.01.\n  - Training LR: 1e-4 (Adam), batch 16–64 (512×512 crops).\n  - NoiseSim schedule: 0.7 prob noneditorial transforms per step; sample 2–4 transforms per image.\n\n- C2PA\n  - Hash: SHA-256 over final watermarked pixel bytes.\n  - Keys: RSA-3072 or ECDSA P-256; rotate every 6–12 months.\n  - Manifest size budget: keep ≤ 100–300 KB; store fingerprint in compressed binary.\n\n- DLT (Polygon PoS)\n  - Gas strategy: maxFeePerGas per network norms; batch writes with multicall for throughput.\n  - Target write throughput: up to ~1e5 KVs/s aggregate via multiple nodes; cost < $0.001 per KV (as reported).\n  - CID size: fit into bytes16–bytes32 to minimize gas; if using 72 bits after BCH, pack into bytes16.\n  - Read path: via provider (e.g., Alchemy) with caching TTL 5–30 min.\n\n- Client models (ONNX Runtime Web)\n  - Extractor model size: 5–25 MB after int8 quantization.\n  - Inference latency (desktop CPU with WASM SIMD): 10–40 ms for 512×512; WebGPU can reduce to 3–10 ms.\n  - Fingerprint-only client: optional 256-dim encoder, 8–15 ms with WebGPU; avoid if privacy mandates no passive lookup.\n\n- Critical vs robust parameters\n  - Critical: ICN threshold, τ, watermark strength s, BCH parity rate, HNSW efSearch.\n  - Robust: projection dim (256 vs 512), bYUV/bLPIPS within given ranges, batch sizes (within GPU budget).\n\n- Scale and hardware dependencies\n  - Index memory: ~1–2 GB per 10M 256-d vectors (float32). With PQ/int8, ~0.3–0.6 GB/10M.\n  - Training HW: A100 40GB or L40S 48GB recommended for joint training of embedder/extractor; V100 32GB acceptable with gradient checkpointing.\n\nApplication_Conditions:\n- Beneficial scenarios\n  - Content distributed via platforms that strip/alter metadata (most social media).\n  - High-volume generative systems (millions/day) needing deterministic provenance recovery.\n  - Environments requiring client-side, privacy-preserving detection (browser extensions).\n  - Workflows needing iterative export/re-export with fresh credentials (rewatermarking support).\n\n- Scale considerations\n  - Fingerprint search becomes advantageous when repository > 1M assets; watermark-triggered lookup avoids querying every image.\n  - DLT indirection is beneficial when manifests are federated across multiple repositories/domains.\n\n- Task compatibility\n  - Works for photographic and CG images; ensure extractor robustness across typical platform renditions.\n  - Harmful/less effective for:\n    - Extremely small thumbnails (<128 px on the short side) where watermark decode and fingerprint quality degrade.\n    - Heavy editorial composites where soft binding properly rejects matches (design intent).\n\n- Hardware requirements\n  - Producer: at least one mid-tier GPU (e.g., L4/A10) to sustain >10 images/s watermarking at 1k resolution; CPU paths achieve 1–3 images/s.\n  - Client: modern browser with WASM SIMD; optional WebGPU for low-latency.\n\n- Alternative comparisons\n  - Metadata-only: simplest but fragile to stripping; choose triad when crossing untrusted platforms.\n  - Fingerprint-only: viable for server-side ingestion; use triad to reduce privacy load and compute by gating on watermark presence.\n  - Proprietary watermarking with secrets: not applicable when public encode/decode is required; use TrustMark + fingerprint binding.\n\n- Resource constraints\n  - If compute-limited on client, disable fingerprint fallback and rely on watermark + DLT; accept that non-watermarked assets won’t resolve.\n  - If DLT is not permissible, replace with centralized K-V; maintain audit logs and signatures to preserve trust.\n\nExpected_Outcomes:\n- Performance/robustness\n  - Watermark imperceptibility: PSNR ≈ 43–46 dB at s ∈ [0.005, 0.02].\n  - Raw bit accuracy: ≈92–98% under typical platform transformations; with BCH (≈28% parity) correct up to ≈4% flips to achieve >99.9% payload recoverability.\n  - Visual lookup precision: two-stage ANN+ICN typically reduces false positives by 10–100× vs ANN alone at the same recall; target FPR ≤ 1e-5 with ICN threshold ≥0.92.\n  - Lookup latency: DLT resolution 20–150 ms (provider-dependent) + manifest fetch 50–200 ms + ICN 5–20 ms; total 100–400 ms typical on desktop.\n\n- Throughput/cost\n  - DLT writes: up to ~1e5 CID maps/s at <$0.001 per write with batched transactions.\n  - OpenSearch query: 2–10 ms for top-k=100 on 10M-scale index per shard; 50–100 ms end-to-end with ICN.\n\n- Timeline expectations\n  - Watermark integration immediate upon model export pipelines; training TrustMark from scratch: 2–7 days on 4×A100 for robust noise sim.\n  - Fingerprint encoder training: 2–5 days on 4×A100 for stable contrastive convergence.\n\n- Trade-offs\n  - Higher watermark strength improves decode robustness but lowers PSNR; keep ≥40 dB for creative acceptance.\n  - Larger projection dim (512) improves recall but increases index memory and latency.\n  - Strict ICN threshold reduces spoof risk but may increase false negatives; tune per risk posture.\n\n- Failure modes\n  - Metadata invalidation: any post-sign pixel change invalidates C2PA; ensure watermarking precedes signing.\n  - Watermark stripping/spoofing: GAN-based recon or adversarial overlays; mitigated by ICN fingerprint check failing (manifest mismatch).\n  - Extreme transformations: heavy crops (<50% area), strong denoise/upscale chains may exceed extractor/BCH capability; expect decode failure.\n  - Passive lookup collisions: visually similar but distinct assets; ICN should reject; if not, tighten threshold or improve negatives.\n  - DLT outages or congested gas markets: delayed mappings; cache last-known good map and retry with exponential backoff.\n\n- Debugging indicators\n  - Healthy pipeline: PSNR ≥ 40 dB post-embed; BCH decoder BER ≤ 4%; ICN acceptance for self-queries ≥ 0.98; C2PA signature valid.\n  - Problems:\n    - BCH decode fails frequently → increase s by +0.002–0.004 or add parity; review NoiseSim coverage.\n    - High ICN false accepts → raise threshold +0.02, add harder negatives, or retrain with adversarial samples.\n    - DLT resolution slow → switch to cached reads/provider failover; verify endpoint URIs.\n\n- Hardware-specific outcomes\n  - WebGPU-capable clients: 2–4× faster extraction vs WASM.\n  - Older CPUs lacking WASM SIMD: expect 2–5× slower extraction; consider server-side decode for heavy pages.\n\nQuality Requirements:\n- Troubleshooting checklist\n  - Confirm operation order: watermark → fingerprint → C2PA sign. Any reversal breaks hard binding.\n  - Validate manifests: signature verification, pixel hash match, presence of fingerprint assertion.\n  - E2E test battery:\n    - Rendition suite: resize {0.5×, 0.75×, 1.5×}, JPEG {95, 80, 60}, crop {10%, 25%}, blur {σ=0.5,1.0}, color jitter ±10%.\n    - Measure BER pre/post BCH, decode rate, ICN acceptance, and PSNR.\n  - Search QA: inject 10k known assets; require top-10 recall ≥ 0.98; FPR ≤ 1e-5 after ICN.\n  - Spoof tests: copy-paste payloads between dissimilar images; ensure ICN rejects mismatches.\n\n- Validation procedures\n  - Golden set with ground-truth CID→manifest maps; nightly regression verifying decode, DLT resolution, and C2PA integrity.\n  - Drift monitoring: track extractor BER and ICN acceptance by platform/domain to detect new platform processing pipelines.\n  - Security review: audit smart contract for reentrancy/overflow; restrict write methods to authorized signers; publish read-only ABI/docs.\n\n- Risks/limitations\n  - Public encode/decode implies inevitable stripping/spoofing attempts; rely on fingerprint/ICN cross-check for security, not obscurity.\n  - Small/thin content (icons, line art) can limit embedding capacity; consider higher parity or skip watermark and rely on fingerprint-only in such cases.\n  - Legal/policy: ensure PKI key management, consent handling (e.g., DECORAIT/ORA) comply with jurisdictional requirements.\n\n- Software/hardware specifics to apply directly\n  - PyTorch 2.1+, torchvision ResNet-50, AdamW; ONNX Runtime Web 1.17+; OpenSearch 2.11+ with k-NN plugin; ethers.js 6.x; Polygon PoS RPC via Alchemy/Infura.\n  - GPU: NVIDIA L4/A10 for inference services; A100/L40S for training; enable AMP (fp16/bf16), cudnn.benchmark=True.\n  - Client: enable WASM SIMD in browser flags if disabled; prefer WebGPU when available.\n\nThis guidance operationalizes the triad of metadata (C2PA), fingerprinting (CNN + ICN), and watermarking (TrustMark + BCH) with DLT-based CID routing to achieve robust, scalable media provenance and authenticity."
