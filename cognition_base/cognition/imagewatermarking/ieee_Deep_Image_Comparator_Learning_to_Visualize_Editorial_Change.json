        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### DESIGN_INSIGHT_HIGH: [Differentiable Dewarping Alignment inside a Two-Stream Comparator – End-to-End Robustness to Out-of-Place Transformations]\nThis work replaces rigid pre-alignment (e.g., geometric verification via RANSAC/MLESAC) and naïve pixel differencing with a differentiable geometric alignment module embedded inside a two-stream image comparator. The comparator learns to localize editorial manipulations while explicitly ignoring benign distribution-induced changes (padding, warps, resizes, recompression, noise).\n\nThe key mechanism is a RAFT-based optical flow estimator that computes dense displacement fields \\( \\{\\rho_x, \\rho_y\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H\\times W} \\) between the query \\(q\\) and the candidate original \\(I\\). A differentiable de-warping unit applies the estimated flow via bilinear sampling:\n\\[\nM : (x,y) \\mapsto (x + \\rho_x(x,y),\\; y + \\rho_y(x,y)), \\quad q' = \\mathrm{DWU}(q\\mid \\rho_x,\\rho_y) = S(M),\n\\]\nwhere \\(S(\\cdot)\\) performs local grid interpolation to render the aligned query. Each image is then encoded to local features using a shared CNN \\(f_E\\): \\(z_q = f_E(q'),\\; z_I = f_E(I) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H'\\times W'\\times C}\\), which are fused via residual blocks \\(f_S\\) into a combined feature \\(z = f_S([z_q, z_I]) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{256}\\).\n\nFundamentally different from prior blind-forensics or two-stream edit-type classifiers, the alignment module is trained end-to-end with the comparator using two objectives: a 3-way cross-entropy classification head\n\\[\nc = E_c(z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3,\\quad L_C = -\\log \\frac{e^{c_y}}{\\sum_{i=1}^3 e^{c_i}},\n\\]\nand a manipulation heatmap head that regresses a low-resolution map \\(E_t(z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{t^2}\\) (with \\(t=7\\)) to a human-annotated target \\(T \\in [0,1]^{t\\times t}\\) via cosine loss\n\\[\nL_T = 1 - \\frac{E_t(z)\\cdot T}{\\|E_t(z)\\|\\,\\|T\\|}.\n\\]\nJoint optimization \\(L = w_c L_C + w_t L_T\\) (\\(w_c=w_t=0.5\\)) provides a learning signal that forces the flow and dewarping to absorb out-of-place geometry while sensitizing the fused representation to true editorial changes. At inference, this yields robust localization with millisecond-level per-pair runtime, obviating slow geometric verification and enabling scalable top‑k re‑ranking.\n\n### DESIGN_INSIGHT_MEDIUM: [Multi-Positive Contrastive Embedding with Manipulations-as-Positives + Dual Quantization – Scalable Near-Duplicate Retrieval under Editorial Change]\nThe paper replaces class/semantic hashing and single-augmentation contrastive encoders with a representation that treats both benign transforms and actual manipulations as positives for the same original. This departs from typical SimCLR-style training by introducing multiple positives per anchor and by redefining “positives” to include Photoshop-edited variants, directly optimizing for near-duplicate retrieval amidst editorial changes.\n\nThe embedding is produced by a ResNet50 with a 256-D projection and an additional “buffer” layer \\(E_b(\\cdot)\\) for metric stability. The contrastive objective uses cosine similarity\n\\[\nd(u,v) = \\frac{E_b(u)\\cdot E_b(v)}{\\|E_b(u)\\|\\,\\|E_b(v)\\|},\n\\]\nand aggregates multiple positives with temperature \\(\\tau\\):\n\\[\nL(z) = -\\log \\frac{\\sum_i e^{d(z, z_i^+) / \\tau} + \\sum_t e^{d(z, z_t^+) / \\tau}}{\\sum_{z^-} e^{d(z, z^-) / \\tau}},\n\\]\nwhere \\(z_i^+\\) are benign-transformed positives and \\(z_t^+\\) are manipulated (also benign-transformed) positives of the same original, while \\(z^-\\) spans other images and their transforms in the minibatch. This multi-positive treatment explicitly learns invariance needed to match “in-the-wild” queries back to trusted originals despite editorial changes.\n\nFor scalability, the work replaces monolithic binary hashing with a two-stage quantization:\n\\[\nb = q_1(z) + q_2\\big(z - q_1(z)\\big) \\in \\{0,1\\}^{128},\n\\]\nwhere \\(q_1\\) assigns \\(z\\) to a coarse KMeans centroid (1024 clusters; inverted list extended to 10 nearest centroids), and \\(q_2\\) performs Product Quantization (PQ) over the residual for compact Hamming search. This design marries training-time robustness (manipulations-as-positives) with retrieval-time efficiency (inverted lists + PQ), yielding interactive large-scale search that is resilient to both in-place and out-of-place benign transformations and minor editorial edits—unlike class-supervised hashing (e.g., DHN/HashNet/CSQ) that relies on semantic labels rather than provenance-preserving invariances.\n\n### DESIGN_INSIGHT_MEDIUM: [Dual-Head Pairwise Comparator with Cosine Heatmap Regression – Shared Local Features, Residual Fusion, and Manipulation-Type Classification]\nInstead of pixel differencing or anomaly-only detectors, the comparator replaces them with a dual-head architecture that fuses shared local features and learns both what changed (localization) and how to interpret the pair (benign/manipulated/distinct). This creates a unified representation \\(z\\) tailored for editorial-change analysis rather than general semantics.\n\nMechanistically, the aligned pair \\((q', I)\\) is processed by a shared local encoder \\(f_E\\) into \\(z_q, z_I \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H'\\times W'\\times C}\\) which are concatenated and passed through residual fusion \\(f_S\\) to yield \\(z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{256}\\). A classification head \\(c=E_c(z)\\in\\mathbb{R}^3\\) predicts the pair type via cross-entropy \\(L_C\\). In parallel, a heatmap head regresses \\(E_t(z)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{t^2}\\) (with \\(t=7\\)) to a target map \\(T\\) using cosine similarity:\n\\[\nL_T = 1 - \\frac{E_t(z)\\cdot T}{\\|E_t(z)\\|\\,\\|T\\|},\\quad T = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathbf{0} & \\text{benign}\\\\\n\\mathbf{1} & \\text{distinct}\\\\\n\\text{crowd-annotated } \\in [0,1]^{t\\times t} & \\text{manipulated}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe joint loss \\(L = w_c L_C + w_t L_T\\) couples localization and classification so the network learns to suppress benign differences while highlighting true manipulations.\n\nDistinct from prior two-stream edit-type labelers, this comparator directly produces a spatial manipulation heatmap de-sensitized to transformation classes (thanks to the upstream differentiable alignment) and a calibrated pair-type probability used downstream for large-scale re-ranking. Practically, the cosine-regressed low-res map (upsampled at inference) balances stability under noise/compression with spatial precision, enabling interpretable overlays while maintaining robustness to common redistribution artifacts.",

        "BACKGROUND": "Title: Deep Image Comparator: Learning to Visualize Editorial Change\n\nHistorical Technical Context:\nPrior to this work, image provenance and manipulation detection were commonly approached along two largely separate tracks: blind forensic detection and content attribution/retrieval. Blind detection relied on statistical or signal-processing cues to localize tampered regions in a single image (e.g., JPEG artifact analysis, splicing detectors, GAN fingerprinting), often using CNNs trained to spot anomalies or specific tool traces. In attribution/retrieval, the dominant paradigm was perceptual hashing and visual search using global image descriptors, evolving from spectral-domain hashing (DCT, wavelets) to deep hashing networks built atop CNN encoders (e.g., AlexNet/ResNet) trained with siamese losses, ranking losses, or supervised quantization. Two-stage retrieval pipelines combined fast approximate nearest neighbor search with a slower geometric verification stage (e.g., MLESAC/RANSAC) to confirm matches by estimating image geometry.\n\nKey developments that motivated this research include: deep metric learning with contrastive/self-supervised objectives (e.g., SimCLR) enabling invariance to augmentations; robustness benchmarks (ImageNet-C) highlighting failure modes under common corruptions; scalable billion-scale similarity search with product quantization on GPUs; and modern optical flow estimators (e.g., RAFT) capable of dense all-pairs correlations for accurate alignment. Meanwhile, social platforms routinely introduce benign transformations—recompression, resizing, padding, warping, blur, and noise—breaking both cryptographic hashes and naive pixel-level comparison. Existing blind detectors often flag benign changes as manipulations, while typical geometric verification is too slow for interactive use at web scale.\n\nThis paper fuses attribution and pairwise comparison: first retrieving a trusted “original” via robust near-duplicate search, then comparing the query-original pair with a learned two-stream CNN that incorporates differentiable de-warping to ignore benign transformations while localizing editorial changes. The architectural paradigm blends end-to-end differentiable alignment (optical-flow-based warping) with fusion, classification, and localization heads, addressing limitations of both blind detection (lack of an original reference) and standard retrieval (sensitivity to benign transformations and slow re-ranking).\n\nTechnical Limitations:\n- Robustness of visual search under benign and minor editorial changes: Classical perceptual hashing and many deep hashing methods are brittle to JPEG recompression, blur, noise, padding, and affine warps, causing retrieval failures. Nearest-neighbor search over float embeddings has O(ND) per-query complexity, which is prohibitive at million-scale without aggressive quantization and indexing.\n- Latency of geometric verification: Second-stage geometric verification (e.g., MLESAC/RANSAC) typically adds up to ~1 s per candidate, forcing very small top-k lists and degrading recall. With k > 10, total latency becomes non-interactive for web-scale systems.\n- Misalignment-induced false differences: Pixel-space or feature-space comparisons without explicit alignment spuriously highlight benign out-of-place transformations (padding/warps). Dense alignment requires computing correlations across all pixel pairs; naive all-pairs correlation is O((HW)^2), necessitating efficient GPU implementations (as in RAFT).\n- Training data and objective limitations in deep hashing: Methods such as DHN/HashNet/CSQ often require class labels or pairwise supervision unavailable in provenance scenarios, and their objectives do not encode invariance to editorial/benign transformation distinctions, leading to poor generalization to ImageNet-C corruptions and warps.\n- Heatmap interpretability and stability: Blind detectors produce noisy activation maps under benign corruptions; thresholding can destabilize localization. Without a principled localization loss tied to ground-truth regions, IoU remains low and user interpretability poor.\n- Scaling memory and compute: Storing 256-D float descriptors for millions of images (≈2M × 256 × 4 bytes ≈ 2 GB) increases memory pressure; binarization to 128 bits reduces memory to ≈32 MB, enabling fast Hamming-space search O(D) bit-ops per candidate while maintaining recall.\n\nPaper Concepts:\n- Near-Duplicate Contrastive Embedding: A global image descriptor learned with an adapted contrastive loss that treats both benign-transformed and manipulated variants as positives relative to the original. For image I, the encoder f outputs z = f(I) ∈ ℝ^{256}. The loss\n  \\[\n  L(z) = -\\log \\frac{\\sum_i e^{d(z, z_i^+)/\\tau} + \\sum_t e^{d(z, z_t^+)/\\tau}}{\\sum_{z^-} e^{d(z, z^-)/\\tau}}\n  \\]\n  uses cosine similarity \\( d(u,v) = \\frac{E_b(u)\\cdot E_b(v)}{\\|E_b(u)\\|\\|E_b(v)\\|} \\), with a buffer layer \\(E_b(\\cdot)\\) and temperature τ. Intuitively, the embedding clusters near-duplicates (including benign and editorial variants) while repelling other images, improving recall under distribution shifts.\n\n- Two-Step Quantization Hashing: A scalable binarization scheme producing a 128-bit code from the 256-D embedding via coarse-to-fine quantization:\n  \\[\n  b = q_1(z) + q_2(z - q_1(z)) \\in \\{0,1\\}^D,\n  \\]\n  where \\(q_1\\) assigns z to one of K = 1024 centroids (inverted list with search over 1 + 10 neighboring lists), and \\(q_2\\) is product quantization of the residual. Coarse indexing reduces candidate set size; fine PQ enables efficient Hamming-space matching, lowering per-query complexity and memory while preserving accuracy.\n\n- Differentiable Warping Unit (DWU): An alignment module that warps the query image to the original using dense optical flow \\(\\{\\rho_x, \\rho_y\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W}\\) estimated by a RAFT-based flow estimator. The mapping\n  \\[\n  M: (x,y) \\mapsto (x + \\rho_x(x,y),\\; y + \\rho_y(x,y)), \\quad \\text{DWU}(q \\mid \\rho_x,\\rho_y) = S(M),\n  \\]\n  with bilinear sampler \\(S(\\cdot)\\), corrects out-of-place transformations (padding/warps), enabling downstream comparison to ignore benign misalignments.\n\n- Image Comparator Network (ICN): A two-stream CNN that encodes the aligned query \\(q' = \\mathrm{FA}(q|I)\\) and the candidate original I via shared local feature extractor \\(f_E\\), producing \\(z_q = f_E(q')\\), \\(z_I = f_E(I) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H' \\times W' \\times C}\\). Concatenated features are fused:\n  \\[\n  z = f_S([z_q, z_I]) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{256},\n  \\]\n  then passed to (i) a 3-way classifier \\(c = E_c(z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\) with cross-entropy loss distinguishing benign, manipulated, and distinct pairs, and (ii) a heatmap head \\(E_t(z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{t^2}\\) producing a t×t manipulation map.\n\n- Manipulation Heatmap Cosine Loss: A localization objective aligning the predicted heatmap with human-annotated ground truth T:\n  \\[\n  L_T = 1 - \\frac{E_t(z) \\cdot T}{\\|E_t(z)\\| \\, \\|T\\|},\n  \\]\n  encouraging spatial activations to match manipulated regions while suppressing benign differences. At inference, the t×t map is upsampled to H×W and optionally thresholded for interpretable overlays.\n\n- Re-Ranking by Distinct Probability: A stage-2 retrieval refinement that sorts the top-k candidates by the predicted “distinct” probability from the ICN classifier. This replaces expensive geometric verification, achieving ≈4 ms per pair inference, enabling k = 100 within interactive latency budgets.\n\nExperimental Context:\nThe evaluation emphasizes discriminative robustness and efficiency for large-scale image attribution plus pairwise manipulation localization. For retrieval, the focus is on top-k instance recall under benign corruptions and editorial changes, using IR@k on a 2M-image corpus (807 trusted originals + ≈2M distractors). Queries cover three regimes: benign-only, manipulated-only, and manipulated+benign. Metrics prioritize IR@1/10/100 and end-to-end latency. The proposed contrastive embedding plus two-step quantization achieves strong stage-1 retrieval; stage-2 ICN re-ranking further boosts IR@1 (overall average 0.8745 vs. 0.7138 stage-1), with per-regime IR@1 of 0.9003 (benign), 0.9206 (manipulated), and 0.8028 (manip+benign). Stage-1 latency ≈40 ms and stage-2 ≈4 ms per pair enable k = 100; “distinct” detection accuracy reaches 98.95%.\n\nFor the comparator, the evaluation covers: (i) 3-way classification accuracy via Average Precision (AP) across benign, manipulated, manipulated+benign, and distinct pairs (AP up to 0.989 overall), with breakdowns by ImageNet-C in-place corruptions and out-of-place transformations; and (ii) localization quality via Intersection over Union (IoU) of thresholded heatmaps against crowd-annotated ground truth (IoU ≈0.551 thresholded; non-thresholded ≈0.563). A user study (MTurk) measures interpretability preference, with ICN thresholded heatmaps preferred by 77.8% (non-thresholded 85.2% when judged across settings). Ablations confirm the necessity of geometric alignment (FA) and joint losses: removing FA drops AP to 0.860 and IoU to 0.431; removing the classification loss reduces localization to 0.0 IoU; freezing modules degrades both detection and localization, underscoring the benefits of end-to-end training.",

With r≈1/8 and T_iter≈12, practical runtime ≈ 4 ms/pair on a GTX 1080 Ti as reported.\n- Space Complexity:\n  - Embedding: O(HW·C_E) activations; parameters ≈ ResNet50 minus classifier + fc(256).\n  - RAFT correlation volume: O((rHrW)^2) (dominant); flow fields O(HW).\n  - ICN feature maps: O(H'W'·C) for each stream; fusion maps O(H'W'·2C).\n  - Hashing: inverted lists store centroids (1024×256) and PQ codes per image (128 bits).\n- Parallelization:\n  - All convolutions, RAFT updates, bilinear sampling, and InfoNCE similarities are GPU-friendly and batched; top-k re-ranking runs embarrassingly parallel over candidate pairs.\n  - Distributed retrieval: shard inverted lists across nodes; compute ICN scores map-reduce style; RAFT flow estimation parallel per pair.\n- Hardware Compatibility:\n  - GPU-efficient memory access via contiguous feature maps; RAFT correlation benefits from high-bandwidth HBM; DWU uses texture units (bilinear sampler) efficiently on GPUs.\n  - CPU inference feasible for retrieval (Hamming) and DWU but RAFT benefits substantially from GPU; mixed precision (FP16) recommended for speed/memory.\n- Training vs. Inference:\n  - Training includes backprop through RAFT and DWU (end-to-end); requires careful gradient scaling; inference omits gradient and uses fewer RAFT iterations.\n  - Heatmap supervision at t=7 reduces label memory and yields stable gradients; inference upsamples heatmap via bilinear interpolation.\n- Parameter Count (approximate):\n  - Embedding: ResNet50 backbone (≈25.6M) + fc(2048→256) (≈0.5M) + buffer Eb (≈256→m, small).\n  - ICN: f_E (3 conv to C=128, ≈0.2–0.5M), f_S (4 residual blocks on 2C channels, ≈1–3M), heads (256→3 and 256→t^2, negligible). RAFT parameters (pretrained) ≈5–6M. Total added over backbone ≈7–10M.\n- Numerical Stability:\n  - Use cosine similarity with temperature τ; normalize Eb outputs (ℓ2) to avoid scale drift; add ε in denominators for safe division.\n  - RAFT flow can be unstable under severe blur/compression; mitigate via downscaled features (r), gradient clipping, and robust data augmentation (ImageNet-C, padding/warps).\n  - Bilinear sampling is differentiable almost everywhere; avoid coordinates outside bounds via clamping.\n- Scaling Behavior:\n  - RAFT correlation scales quadratically with pixels at flow resolution; keep r small and H,W bounded (e.g., 256–512) for interactive speeds.\n  - Larger k in re-ranking scales linearly in ICN cost; pipeline remains real-time due to 4 ms/pair; retrieval IR@k saturates near k≈10–100 per reported curves.\n  - Heatmap resolution t governs localization granularity/stability; small t (7) favors interpretability and robustness, but limits detection of many tiny edits (acknowledged limitation).",
        "IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE": "Integration_Strategy:\n- Near-duplicate search (Stage 1)\n  - Replace your existing image feature encoder with ResNet50 where the classification head is replaced by:\n    - fc_embed: Linear(2048 -> 256) to produce z = f(I) ∈ R256.\n    - fc_buffer Eb: Linear(256 -> 256) used only within the loss for cosine similarity.\n  - Implement a multi-positive contrastive loss (SimCLR-style, but with multiple positives per anchor):\n    - For each image I in the batch, treat manipulated variants and benign-transformed variants as positives.\n    - All other images in the batch (and their augmented variants) are negatives.\n    - Code-level change: In your PyTorch training loop, build a positive mask P ∈ {0,1}^{B×B} for batch items that share the same source image ID, where B is batch size (e.g., 64).\n    - Compute cosine similarity on Eb(u)/||Eb(u)||, Eb(v)/||Eb(v)|| and apply temperature τ.\n  - Hashing and index:\n    - Use FAISS GPU and build IndexIVFPQ (coarse + fine quantization):\n      - q1: KMeans with nlist=1024 clusters on the 256-D embeddings z (coarse quantizer).\n      - q2: Product Quantization (PQ) with m=16 sub-quantizers and 8 bits per code (total 128-bit descriptor).\n    - Set nprobe=10 to search 10 nearest inverted lists per query.\n    - Migration path: If you already use a FAISS flat index, switch to IndexIVFPQ by training the coarse quantizer on your database embeddings, then add PQ codes. Keep the original z for re-ranking if needed, but prefer the ICN classifier for second-stage culling (below).\n- Image Comparator Network (Stage 2)\n  - Insert geometric alignment module FA before pairwise feature extraction:\n    - Flow estimator: integrate RAFT (PyTorch) to estimate dense optical flow ρx, ρy between the query q and candidate original I.\n    - De-warping unit (DWU): apply flow to q via torch.nn.functional.grid_sample (bilinear sampler). Normalize flow to [-1,1] relative to H,W before grid_sample.\n    - Code-level: Define DWU(q, flow) -> q’ using a grid built from base coordinates + normalized flow.\n  - Prediction module FP:\n    - Shared feature extractor fE: 3× Conv2d blocks with Conv-BN-ReLU-MaxPool producing zq, zI ∈ R^{H’×W’×128} at 1/4 input resolution (H’=H/4, W’=W/4, C=128).\n    - Concatenate [zq, zI] along channels; pass through fS: 4 ResNet residual blocks + AvgPool + fc_fuse: Linear(... -> 256) yielding fused feature z ∈ R256.\n    - Heads:\n      - Classification head Ec: Linear(256 -> 3) to output logits for {benign, manipulated, distinct}.\n      - Heatmap head Et: Linear(256 -> t^2) with t=7.

Each image has 3 positives (original, manipulated, benign-transformed).\n  - Temperature τ: recommended 0.1–0.5; start at 0.2; lower values sharpen similarities but may destabilize with many positives.\n  - KMeans clusters (q1): 1024 (nlist=1024). Train on 1–5M embeddings; use faiss.Clustering.\n  - PQ (q2): m=16, bits_per_code=8 (total 128 bits). Use faiss.IndexIVFPQ with nprobe=10.\n  - Probing: nprobe ∈ [8, 16]; set to 10 by default. Higher nprobe improves recall but increases latency.\n- Image Comparator Network (Stage 2)\n  - Input size: H=W=512 for RAFT stability; if memory-bound, 384–448 works with small RAFT; ensure both images are resized identically.\n  - RAFT: initialize with KITTI pretrained weights; train end-to-end with rest of ICN.\n    - Learning rate: 1e-4 (ADAM β1=0.9, β2=0.999, weight_decay=0).\n    - Gradient clipping: 1.0 to stabilize joint training with flow.\n  - fE: three Conv-BN-ReLU-MaxPool blocks to get 1/4 resolution; channels: [64, 96, 128].\n  - fS: 4 ResNet blocks; fuse with AvgPool + fc_fuse to 256.\n  - Heads:\n    - Ec: Linear(256 -> 3); use CrossEntropyLoss.\n    - Et: Linear(256 -> 49), t=7. Cosine loss LT with ground-truth heatmap T ∈ R^{7×7}.\n  - Loss weights: wc=wt=0.5. If localization underperforms, raise wt to 0.7; if classifier degrades, raise wc to 0.7.\n  - Heatmap threshold for visualization: 0.35 (empirical); range 0.30–0.45 depending on noise.\n- Augmentations (used in both stages)\n  - Primary: resize to target H×W; JPEG re-compress with quality q ∈ [40, 90].\n  - In-place (ImageNet-C severity 1–5): Gaussian/shot/impulse noise; Gaussian/motion/defocus blur; brightness/contrast/snow.\n  - Out-of-place: padding ≤ 10% per side; rotation ≤ 15°; random crop retaining ≥ 90% area; horizontal flip; affine warp.\n  - Aug strategy: always apply primary; then randomly pick in-place or out-of-place or both with equal probability.\n- Critical vs robust parameters\n  - Critical: τ, nprobe, input H×W, wc/wt balance, t=7 (heatmap resolution).\n  - Robust: batch size (≥32), exact channels in fE/fS, optimizer choice (ADAM vs AdamW).\n- Hardware-dependent settings\n  - GPU ≥ 11 GB (e.g., GTX 1080 Ti, RTX 3080) for H=W=512. If ≤ 8 GB, use H=W=384 and RAFT-small; reduce k to 50.\n  - Mixed precision (autocast) recommended; expect ~30–40% memory reduction.\n  - FAISS GPU: use 1–4 GPU shards for >10M database items; increase nlist proportionally to database size (2048–4096 for 10–50M).\n\nApplication_Conditions:\n- Beneficial scenarios\n  - Large image databases (≥1M) where near-duplicate retrieval must tolerate benign transformations and minor editorial changes.\n  - Forensic or provenance workflows where an online image needs to be matched to trusted originals and manipulated regions visualized.\n  - Platforms where metadata/watermarks are unreliable or stripped; content-only matching is required.\n- Hardware requirements\n  - Single GPU with ≥11 GB VRAM for full-resolution RAFT+ICN; FAISS GPU for fast Stage 1 on millions of images.\n  - CPU-only feasible for indexing but expect large latency; Stage 2 ICN on CPU is not recommended for interactive use.\n- Scale considerations\n  - Stage 2 advantage grows with k; use k=100 when per-pair inference ≤ 4 ms (GPU). For smaller GPUs, k=50–75 strikes a balance.\n  - IndexIVFPQ becomes advantageous over flat search at ≥1M items; below that, a flat L2 or cosine index can suffice.\n- Task compatibility\n  - Best for photo manipulations with localized changes (splicing, insertions, retouching). The ICN specifically de-emphasizes benign in-place/out-of-place transforms.\n  - Neutral/limited benefit: extremely small manipulations below 1/7 of image resolution or severe global degradations.\n  - Not intended for video; extend with temporal alignment/optical flow if needed.\n- Alternative comparisons\n  - Use ICN Stage 2 re-ranking over classical geometric verification (MLESAC) when latency constraints are tight (interactive UX). GV may be preferred offline when precision must be maximized and latency is irrelevant.\n- Resource constraints\n  - Memory-limited deployments: use RAFT-small, H=W=384, reduce k to 50, and keep nprobe ≤ 8.\n  - Compute-limited: pre-filter candidates with a lightweight distinctness predictor using cosine distance on z prior to ICN.\n\nExpected_Outcomes:\n- Performance improvements\n  - Retrieval (2M-image database):\n    - Average IR@1 improves from ~0.714 (Stage 1) to ~0.875 (Stage 1+2), +16% absolute.\n    - Benign queries: IR@1 ~0.900 vs 0.759 (Stage 1).\n    - Manipulated queries: IR@1 ~0.921 vs 0.811 (Stage 1).\n    - Manip+Benign: IR@1 ~0.803 vs 0.572 (Stage 1).\n  - Latency:\n    - Stage 1: ~40 ms per query (GTX 1080 Ti).\n    - Stage 2: 4 ms per pair × k=100 ≈ 400 ms; total ≈ 440 ms; interactive.\n- Classifier accuracy (Stage 2)\n  - Distinct detection AP ~0.989 overall; specific study reports 98.95% “distinct” accuracy.\n  - Benign pairs misclassified as manipulated in ~3.6% of cases.\n  - Manip+Benign pairs misclassified as not manipulated in ~11.5% of cases.\n- Heatmap localization\n  - IoU ≈ 0.55–0.56 against 7×7 ground truth (thresholded vs non-thresholded).\n  - User interpretability preference favors the proposed method; reported preferences: thresholded ~77.8%, non-thresholded ~85.2% (choose per UX context; thresholded often clearer under noisy transforms).\n- Timeline expectations\n  - Immediate retrieval gains after integrating ICN re-ranking; full ICN benefits require end-to-end training to stabilize FA+FP.\n  - Hash index training (KMeans + PQ) for millions of images can take hours on GPU; done offline.\n- Trade-offs\n  - ICN adds inference cost but enables larger k with controlled latency; substantial top-1 precision gains.\n  - Heatmap resolution (t=7) limits detection of very fine manipulations; increasing t improves localization but increases model size and may require more supervision.\n- Failure modes\n  - Severe benign degradation (extreme noise/blur/compression) can trigger spurious detections or miss manipulations.\n  - Poor geometric alignment (flow errors on large padding/occlusions) reduces both classification and localization accuracy.\n  - Many small manipulations scattered across the image may not be separated due to 7×7 heatmap resolution.\n- Debugging indicators\n  - RAFT flow magnitude histograms: excessively large or uniform flows suggest alignment failure; visualize q vs DWU(q|ρ).\n  - Classification calibration: “distinct” scores should be high for random pairs; expect AP >0.95 on validation; if lower, check FA alignment and wc weight.\n  - Heatmap sanity: threshold at 0.35 should highlight manipulated regions on validation examples; if maps are uniformly low/high, check Et head and LT normalization.\n  - Retrieval sanity: increasing nprobe should monotonically improve recall; if not, verify KMeans training and PQ code size alignment.\n- Hardware-specific outcomes\n  - On RTX 3080/3090 with AMP: expect 30–40% memory reduction and up to 1.3–1.5× throughput vs FP32; ICN per-pair inference can drop to ~2–3 ms.\n  - On ≤8 GB GPUs: reduce input size, use RAFT-small, lower k; expect modest recall reduction (~1–3% IR@1).\n\nQuality Requirements:\n- Troubleshooting\n  - If ICN classifier frequently flags benign as manipulated (>10%), lower τ to sharpen similarities in Stage 1, increase wc to 0.7, and verify augmentation balance.\n  - If heatmaps are noisy, raise threshold to 0.4–0.45 and apply 3×3 morphological opening post-upsample; optionally increase t to 9 and retrain.\n  - If FAISS recall at k=100 plateaus early, increase nlist to 2048–4096 and retrain quantizer; ensure database embeddings are well-distributed (check KMeans inertia).\n- Validation procedures\n  - Build PSBat-Pair-like validation splits: benign, manipulated, manip+benign, distinct; report AP for each class.\n  - Measure IR@k curves (k=1..100) for benign/manipulated/manip+benign queries; verify Stage 1+2 saturates by k≈10.\n  - IoU evaluation: threshold at 0.35, upsample heatmap to H×W, compare to 7×7 ground truth rescaled to H×W; track mean IoU and failure cases.\n- Software/hardware dependencies\n  - PyTorch + CUDA, FAISS GPU, RAFT PyTorch weights (KITTI), ImageNet-C assets, mixed precision (autocast).\n  - Recommended GPU memory: ≥11 GB; for large indices, multiple GPUs or FAISS IVF sharding."
