    def get_cognition(self) -> str:
        return """Relevant Research Context:

The DeltaNet architecture builds upon several key innovations in linear attention:

1. **Linear Attention Mechanisms**: Unlike quadratic attention in standard transformers,
   linear attention achieves O(n) complexity by avoiding explicit computation of attention matrices.

2. **Delta Rule**: Inspired by Hebbian learning, the delta rule updates associative memory
   states incrementally, allowing for efficient sequential processing.

3. **Forgetting Mechanism**: The beta parameter enables selective forgetting of past information,
   crucial for maintaining relevant context in long sequences.

4. **State Space Models**: Related to recent advances in state space models like Mamba and S4,
   which also achieve linear complexity through recurrent-like computations.

    def get_motivation(self) -> str:
        return """Research Motivation for DeltaNet Architecture:

The development of efficient attention mechanisms for long sequence modeling represents a critical challenge in modern NLP. Standard transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length, limiting practical applications to relatively short contexts. This motivates exploration of linear attention variants.

Key Research Questions:
1. How can we maintain the expressiveness of attention while achieving linear complexity?
2. What role does memory and forgetting play in sequential information processing?
3. How can biological learning principles inform neural architecture design?

DeltaNet Approach:
The delta rule, inspired by Hebbian learning from neuroscience, provides a principled way to update associative memories. By combining this with a learnable forgetting mechanism (beta parameter), DeltaNet can selectively retain and update relevant information while processing sequences efficiently.

Scientific Impact:
This architecture serves as a testbed for understanding the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model expressiveness in sequence modeling. It provides a foundation for systematic exploration of:
- Alternative update rules for linear attention
- Different forgetting mechanisms and schedules
- Hybrid architectures combining linear and quadratic attention
- Scaling laws for linear attention models

The goal is to push the boundaries of what's possible with efficient sequence modeling while maintaining or improving upon transformer performance."""
