Architecture Overview:
- Model Type: Neural Encoder-Decoder Image Watermarking System
- Core Innovation: Resolution-scaled residual embedding with top-k minimax noise scheduling
- Key Components: MUNIT-style encoder, ConvNeXt-base decoder, multi-objective fidelity loss
- Capacity: Up to 256-bit payloads (128-bit UUID + BCH error correction)

Performance Analysis:
- Imperceptibility Metrics (100-bit payload):
  * PSNR: ~51.4 dB on DIV2K and DALL·E 3 datasets
  * SSIM: ~0.998 (near-perfect perceptual similarity)
  * 9-14 dB PSNR improvement over TrustMark, SSL, StegaStamp
- Robustness Results (medium-strength distortions):
  * Clean images: 100% bit accuracy
  * JPEG compression: 97.5-99.5% accuracy
  * Geometric transforms (rotation ±10°, crop 25%): 97-100% accuracy
  * Photometric transforms (blur, noise, color): 100% accuracy

Architectural Strengths:
1. Resolution-scaled residuals minimize artifacts at high resolution (2K-4K images)
2. Top-k worst-case optimization focuses training on hardest distortions
3. Three-stage training (decoder → fidelity → robustness) ensures stable convergence
4. ConvNeXt decoder without BatchNorm improves stability and subtle signal recovery
5. Multi-objective loss (YUV MSE + LPIPS + FFL + WGAN) balances imperceptibility

Areas for Improvement:
1. Vulnerability to adversarial attacks when image quality drops below ~25 dB PSNR
2. Potential forgery via residual replay (mitigated by fingerprint binding)
3. Subtle color-striping artifacts in uniform regions at high magnification
4. Robustness degrades beyond training bounds (rotation >10°, crops >25%)

This architecture establishes a strong foundation for high-capacity, imperceptible watermarking with robust provenance verification."""

    def get_cognition(self) -> str:
        return """Relevant Research Context:

The InvisMark architecture builds upon the evolution of digital image watermarking:

1. **Classical Watermarking**: Early methods used pixel-domain (LSB embedding) and frequency-domain
   approaches (DWT/DCT, SVD) that were lightweight but brittle to compression and geometric transforms.
   These methods struggled with the imperceptibility-robustness trade-off.

2. **Neural Encoder-Decoder Watermarking**: CNN-based architectures (HiDDen, RivaGAN, StegaStamp)
   enabled learned steganography with perceptual losses (LPIPS) and adversarial training, improving
   both imperceptibility and robustness through end-to-end optimization.

3. **Resolution Scaling**: TrustMark introduced universal resolution scaling to handle arbitrary
   image sizes, but struggled with high-resolution outputs and larger payloads (>100 bits).

4. **Robust Optimization**: Traditional training used random augmentation, risking overfitting to
   average-case perturbations. InvisMark's top-k minimax approach targets worst-case distortions
   while maintaining computational efficiency.

5. **Provenance Standards**: The rise of generative AI (Stable Diffusion, DALL·E) and deepfakes
   spurred C2PA standards for signed metadata, but metadata can be stripped during sharing,
   motivating robust "soft binding" via watermarking.

Key Papers:
- "HiDDen: Hiding Data With Deep Networks" (Zhu et al., 2018): Early neural watermarking
- "StegaStamp" (Tancik et al., 2020): Noise-hardened encoding for real-world robustness
- "TrustMark" (Meng et al., 2023): Universal resolution scaling for arbitrary image sizes
- "SSL Watermarking" (Fernandez et al., 2023): Latent space approaches

InvisMark advances the field by combining resolution-scaled residuals, ConvNeXt stability,
and worst-case robust optimization to achieve high-capacity (256-bit), imperceptible (PSNR ~48-51),
and robust (>97% accuracy) watermarking for modern high-resolution AI-generated images."""

    def get_motivation(self) -> str:
        return """Research Motivation for InvisMark Watermarking Architecture:

The proliferation of AI-generated images (DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney) and concerns about
deepfakes have created an urgent need for reliable provenance verification. While C2PA metadata standards
provide cryptographic signatures, metadata can be easily stripped during social media sharing, motivating
the need for "soft binding" through imperceptible, robust watermarking embedded directly in pixel content.

Key Research Questions:
1. How can we embed high-capacity identifiers (256-bit UUIDs with error correction) while maintaining
   near-perfect imperceptibility (PSNR >48 dB, SSIM >0.997)?
2. How can watermarks survive real-world manipulations (JPEG compression, color adjustments, crops,
   rotations) that occur during typical sharing and editing workflows?
3. How can we efficiently train robust encoders without incurring prohibitive computational costs
   from worst-case optimization over many distortion types?
4. How can we scale watermarking to modern high-resolution outputs (2K-4K images) from generative models?

InvisMark Approach:
Resolution-scaled residual embedding addresses the scalability challenge by operating at downscaled resolution,
reducing compute by ~16× while maintaining imperceptibility. Top-k minimax noise scheduling focuses training
on the hardest distortions (rotation, aggressive crops, heavy JPEG) without evaluating all noises every step,
achieving >7× efficiency gain. Three-stage training (decoder → fidelity → robustness) ensures stable convergence
by avoiding early exposure to hard geometric transforms. ConvNeXt decoder without BatchNorm improves stability
and subtle signal recovery compared to ResNet-based alternatives.

Scientific Impact:
This architecture demonstrates that the payload-imperceptibility-robustness triad can be favorably balanced
at high resolution and high capacity, enabling practical provenance applications:
- Content authentication: Exact UUID retrieval with BCH error correction confirms origin
- C2PA soft binding: Watermarked identifiers survive metadata stripping
- Multi-watermark co-embedding: Layered provenance for creator + platform + distributor chains
- Deepfake mitigation: Absence of expected watermark flags synthetic content

The system provides a foundation for systematic exploration of:
- Stronger robustness to adversarial removal attacks through fingerprint binding
- Multi-resolution embedding strategies for bandwidth-limited scenarios
- Real-time watermarking integration with diffusion model decoders
- Trade-offs between payload capacity, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency

The goal is to enable trustworthy AI-generated content ecosystems where provenance can be reliably verified
even after typical transformations, supporting transparency while minimizing user-visible degradation."""
